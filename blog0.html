<h3><a name="_gjdgxs"></a><span lang=EN-GB>11-June-2023     Sunday ☔</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Long line for CX524 flight!! I checked
repeatedly that I'm at the correct gate. Lay down for like 2.5 hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Finally, I heard the announcement. I'm
ready to zonk out on the flight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Boarding
time was supposed to be 12.40am, now 1.33am boohoo I didn’t pay attention to
what’s the reason for the delay. Updated Dominic (Singapore student host whose
gf rented out the apartment to me) and </span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>俊鑫。</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>headache diminished because it’s past
the witching hours. It’s also quite stuffy on the plane right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I slept for 3.5 hours or something which
I'm quite proud of! At least 2 cycles. I'm so thankful that there was no one
making noise on the flight and that the two passengers that had to get through
me to the aisle actually stayed in their seat throughout the whole flight. Also
I realized that as a romantic couple, they didn't actually talk much which is
interesting to me. Note the guy was awake and watching movie <a>all the way
haha.</a><a class=msocomanchor id="_anchor_1"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Omg so I actually reached EARLY at 6:40am
local time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And now it's about 7:28 a.m. local time and
I was just impressed with the amount of courtesy and patience that the
biometric scanning officer had. He apologized, he used a mix of some Japanese
and English, he greeted everyone with a really clear and crisp and friendly
good morning. I feel like this extremely high standard of professionalism
courtesy and slight apologetic demeanour is kind of like an outlier even in the
extremely polite Japanese society, or maybe I'm wrong haha. Waiting in line for
the customs officer now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Okay 10 minutes later I'm done and just got
through luggage claim and the lady there was also extremely courteous. Now
customs inspection. The sniffing doggo was cute! &#128021;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And then Junxin picked me up and sent a
photo to my dad to reassure him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>8am to 9.30am driving! His Porsche is
amazing and we talked about family members, his life and work and kids, and my
experiences. He's a really nice dude oh my doing private equity and earning
tons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Firstly the shop is very Japanese with the
aged staff who are hobbling a bit but still ever courteous and patient.
Secondly the tempura is decent! I like the starchy pieces and the lotus root,
as well as the fresh prawn which doesn’t taste as much as those frozen shrimps
that are preserved to make them Q</span><span lang=ZH-CN>弹</span><span
lang=EN-GB> but more like something freshly bought today. Shrimp was memorable!
Noodle soup was just bonito flake flavored with a hint of sourness and nothing
that I like. Altogether 1200 yen which was a little less than what I saw on the
menu. Secondly I was trying to fumble for the 100 yen coins and told the owner
it’s my first time to Japan and he reacted pleasantly. Also I left my umbrella
at the door and had to turn back to find. And I had a 30 minute walk trying to
get back to the same place (near a school basketball court) where Junxin
right-turned in the morning. I was veering a bit further to ANOTHER apartment
labelled block 14 but I realised I need to stay at 1-chōme  </span><span
lang=ZH-CN>一町目</span><span lang=EN-GB> and then find 14th street and enter
that. Mosquitoes came to haunt me during this walk so at 4pm I’m safely nested
at home. Boiled water and did laundry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The mugicha from above is bought from the
vending machine at the road outside my house for ¥110 or something along that
line, I think I used a note to get coins change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Nighttime
is when it gets insanely vibrant and lit. I walked to ikenoue </span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>池の上　</span><span lang=EN-GB

cheap shop with cool machine that has a tiny LED panel for every single

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>which
was quite cheap but low quality though I was just exploring something novel
that’s different from Katsu don which might’ve tasted better. I then searched
for the orange Ginza</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>銀座</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> line for quite a while
before finding the entrance, amidst a dazzling display of billboards, crowds
surrounding the Shibuya scramble square and just most people being unmasked and
showing some excitement in their own bustling realities. I do see rather sus
signs in Shibuya where females enter certain floors of a night-life building
for free and there are cute speech bubbles with provocative texts to attract
guys. Also, people are fashionable unlike in Singapore and USA.</span><img

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Here’s a poster of the volleyball team in
which I remember Nishida being really amazing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Btw the shortest girl is the same height as
me! The 180cm girl looks very cool! Like a superhero.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I might have to leave at 7am tomorrow but
we’ll see. The life of a commuter. The train is taking longer than I expect,
I’m only at G-08 right now, after like close to 20 minutes on the train. I will
need to budget more time in the morning — especially if I’m grabbing food. I
guess I’m gonna get something tonight to put in the fridge, if not I’m gonna be
so hungry before lunch break.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Finally I reached Ginza and was it a
gorgeous sight. It had a fullness of a mature chimera with fangs of light and
color, and every storefront was clean and sharp as a knife. There was no trace
of abandonment — one of the defining traits of Japanese architecture is that it
always seemed to be tended to and maintained. I took a 5 minute walk to my
workplace; asked the security what’s the main entrance and he showed me, upon
which I set my phone on the floor and took a bunch of photos, to the puzzled glances
of passers-by who saw my phone flash across the road, propped against the
floor. P&amp;E at 8F tomorrow.</span><img width=246 height=329

about work makes me realise the gravity of my summer plan. I'm probably

the more whacky styles and anime type cosplay, some of which were quite
stunning. Japan rail is giving Seoul Korea energy with all the switching

signs and reminders, and unique inventions that cater to the tendency of the
Japanese to conform and not stick out, eat individually sometimes and not
interact with the unknown as much as possible. Finally I head from G02 to G01
Shibuya at 8:36pm. Hunting for dinner round 2. when I was loitering about the
exit from Shibuya station, the moment I heard </span><span lang=ZH-CN

singers, I got goosebumps; a gang of male and female Japanese teenagers started
singing along as they passed; and it just melted perfectly together, the blood
rush-inducing rock song from a singer I’ve listened to for years, and the neon
lights and blaring street signs and anime characters across the walls and the
impeccable fashion. They all merged together and created a little Japan wooing
that I’d always imagined, whenever I hear or see Japanese stuff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>8:50pm I got goosebumps when I saw the

is crazy to me because he’s just a junior consultant who started working for 2
months. I told him this is indeed what I expected of Japanese work culture.
Also my Japanese got so good at the end of the day compared to the start it’s
crazy. The other 2001 dude is Watanabe, he studied Literature in Keio </span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>慶應大学</span><span lang=EN-GB

lang=EN-GB>chū-ka</span><span lang=ZH-CN>料理</span><span lang=EN-GB> ryōri shop
for the first time, I was hoping the owners are Chinese and asked in Japanese
if the lady knew Chinese but she said no haha. Apparently there’s a big wave of
chūka frenzy in Japan so I guess that’s why the couple decided to imitate
Chinese food lmao. I’m waiting for it still at 7:30pm but no hurries; I just
feel bad seeing the number of hunchbacked old ladies who’ll keep working for
many more years because they have to and Tokyo is expensive; please don’t give
the argument they enjoy their work, though maybe they get used to it and the
habit of just toiling day and night sticks. There’s a 80+ year old lady and a
60+ year old lady serving and the old uncle is doing stir fry. And a nice TV
that’s playing a typical Japanese show with a boisterous background voice
entitled </span><span lang=ZH-CN>冒険少年</span><span lang=EN-GB>bōken shoūnen
which features a bunch of young people in the wild and a tiny panel for the
reactions of people watching in the studio. Some kind of wilderness survival
show I guess. I just think about the amount of effort to make all the glittery
fonts and the animations! And the awareness that the sheer number of people
working hard is something hard to comprehend. Felt the stark contrast to a
society like Australia where it’s all about rest and outdoors. Anyway, I see my
meal being prepared in front of me and am excited to try. Here’s it:</span><img

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After this meal, I felt pretty emotional
and was almost gonna burst out saying that I’m from China and this Chinese stir
fry hit my soft spot. But no I just fumbled for my wallet and handed ¥1150 to

really find the right coins (Bruh the <a>50¥ coin has a hole in it, it’s giving

same tone and never sounds tired saying arigato gozaimasu to every customer,
and for some customers she even stepped all the way to the door to bow and say
thanks again. I will visit this store again also because I get free chilli oil,
</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>ふりかけ</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>furikake/Benito  to accompany
the last mouthfuls of white rice because I ate so much beansprouts at one go,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The most insane thing is that I walked home
from the restaurant without a map or opening my phone. I simply identified
every red light projection on the ground (a apt warning at cars to stop), every
quaint picturesque soba shop and every parking lot that I’d seen on the first
day in Tokyo. This is serious character development because I’d always needed
maps; I thought I’d gotten lost when I walked to </span><span lang=ZH-CN>一丁目</span><span

awash in spring water, without a speck of dust, no kidding; and the shopping
malls with the flushing and the signs that tell you how the running water keeps
pipes unclogged and keeps smells away; food is actually cheap and healthy and
so much variety, partly thanks to culture and to the old staff toiling away at

to my buzzing phone at 7:12am with a dry scratchy feeling in my throat that
could only mean that my body has not had time to fight off the virus. I was
also tired and toyed with the idea of taking a covid test for a hot second,

work they’ll probably just soldier through it — I see bloodshot eyes and pimpled
skin of my senior consultants, they probably overwork. But I miss my nap time
and may nap in noon since they provide rear facing red sofas in the office lol.

typing on the computer because I considered taking notes: that meeting room C
has no whiteboard, meeting room E has, meeting rooms G and H are smaller so
preferred not to use them, that sort of thing. I swear to God every time I walk
by anyone, NO ONE is looking at phones or anything other than Microsoft suite
(Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint) and it is truly scary the number of words and data
they can squeeze onto an Excel sheet like hello kids please protect your eyes.
There’s a young intern on my right and she’s doing slides and Excel like super
legit vibes but her makeup also cannot conceal her overworked fatigue with
eyebags and yellowed skinny hands, I feel like Japanese just carry with them a
sense of apology and a need to add value no matter how hard they work. Anyway
before I left for lunch, Shimada CEO whose name I had read about a lot inside
all the P&amp;E reports that they sent me (which I eventually did not finish
summarising, too busy enjoying my holiday), greeted me and apologised that he’s
not able to meet me. Trope part 2: give the other person a sense of
satisfaction and make them lose their guard (being apologised to by the amazing
CEO of P&amp;E who created this team of geniuses). He said in English that he
had lived in Boston and asked me where I will be living, upon which he
expressed slight surprise when I said that I will be living in the Harvard
dormitory for all 4 years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Walked to the nearby 7 Eleven in Ginza for
the first time, and by golly, since I have been researching about these
successful Japanese companies, is it the best 7 Eleven I have ever visited,
with a sitting area and a microwave, and the cashier who was nice enough to
guide me to the microwave and instruct me on how to use it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Came
back from lunch at my work desk at 1:04pm. Before that, I was in the toilet and
had a peeing conversation. This Suzuki</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:
"Arial Unicode MS"'>鈴木</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>
san whose hair looks slightly curly and greasy greeted me</span><a><span

reaction is usually slow and I had to get him to repeat which he did, in
English. We proceeded to have a fluent conversation in Japanese and I said
(with inner resent) I don’t get paid so I chose to go to a convenience store or
konbini in Japanese. He laughed when he heard I lunched there. Oh I forgot to
ask where he lunched but I’ll ask him tomorrow. I confirmed with him that his
name is like the Japanese car brand upon which he gave a light-hearted confirmation.
I asked him where he was sitting in the office. I’m kinda lazy to follow up but
also seems like manners to follow up since I’m the lowest life form and am
subjugated to all these big geniuses doing PowerPoint and Excel magic HAHAHA.
Anyway I also had a good 22 minute conversation with Yiyi: the first time we
could talk during work hours thanks to all my senpais being busy during
lunchtime, <a>thank God</a><a class=msocomanchor id="_anchor_29"

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=276 height=369
src="./image044.jpg" align=left hspace=12 vspace=12></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was ¥518 with tax, itadakimasu. The
cashier was from Yangon, Myanmar and he came here 2 years ago; pretty good
Japanese, as usual his surname is Aung and I chatted a tiny bit with him, his
surname was Aung just like most of the Japanese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And then I feel Mr I slowing
exerting his power on me hahaha such as by not wiping the whiteboard with me
which he did on the first 2 days, and purposely walking in front of me to the
other dude Fujimi to talk till 2:12pm even though we agreed to meet at 2pm this
morning (obviously, this is because I made him wait a few times to properly
pack my stuff, as all these people are normally very on time and will be
waiting for you to depart for lunch or the meeting like 2 or 3 minutes before;
or I am just overthinking and he is prioritising the stuff that actually brings
him lots of money in the long run). But I still like I. He laughed for
the first time when I told him I’m not in my most daijoubu state and might have
a virus, like actually a loud laugh in the elevator. And we were pretty chill
and smiley when we walked to the pharmacy which was just downstairs ooops I
stopped here at 3:32pm because after getting the medicine I was just talking
for like 1 hour in japanese about my research on NFT, crypto, illustrated
books, edtech, stamp maker, crypto+chat messenger industries in japan and
globally and the outlook for the app service one Japan company was trying to
make. Okay before I started the presentation, I asked about the policy for
remote work and was pushing the limit (“sir what if I remote work all 5 days
next week”) but he settled upon a 1:1 ratio where in 10 working days, I can
work from home for 5 days. Truly amazing and I only realised after like 1 hour
that this means I can video call and play games and watch shows with my one and
only Yiyi online! Via tencent call or something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Me
at 4.38pm: you see in japan they don't show impressed or good they would just
deal with the content, see what's missing, and keep working. They’ll say
thanks, </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>辛苦了</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>=</span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>お疲れ様です</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> but not much more than that with
regards to work - there’s always patches to fill and no one will ever approach
100% or perfection. Also this man Morimoto lazy lah (not really) but he hinted
I should ask the RBF Korea woman (who was pissed I knocked her chair
accidentally) how she splits the screen into two and does Korean + Japanese
instant translation, or Japanese + Chinese and so on. I first saw her this
morning and her RBF is strong - she doesn’t return the morning greetings of
other consultants haha let me find out her name. Her name is Cheh or something
like that and I don’t want to disturb her. Also she has no Korean accent at all
when she spoke Japanese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Okay so funny thing I thought the smoking
room was just for sitting down and went to 3 different floors realised people
occupying it so I went to 6 floor and a random cubicle and started eating my
delicious stir fried veggies and meat. Before that, I asked Aiko Ohno san for
help regarding the microwave to heat food (I forgot that it is called </span><span
lang=ZH-CN>電子レンジ</span><span lang=EN-GB>) and she decided to give me a free mug
with P&amp;E directions on it yayyy now I can brush my teeth with that mug ☕️
Ohno-san is really like a motherly figure uwu. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By 5pm I finished part 2 of lunch yay it
tastes better than my previous lunch set! It was also cheaper and I guess
because it was stir fried there might have been of wok hey kind of fragrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><img border=0 width=227 height=403

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>From
the remote work arrangement of 1:1, I am birthing my grand travel plans. I can
technically work in person on Monday and Tuesday, book a train for Tuesday
night and be in Kobe by then, and then reach Kobe and start remote work on
Wednesday. So I can stay in Kobe</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:
"Arial Unicode MS"'>神戸</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>
for like 5 days before returning on Sunday night, all freshly recharged! I was
gonna text my parents about this grand plan but decided against it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I eventually sent an audio to share my
plan. Took from Ginza to Shibuya and waited a bit for Ayumi because she was
shopping for parting gifts for her colleagues at the national parliament at
Hikarie, another shopping mall nearby and I hadn’t responded to her text at
6:37pm and we met a little after the agreed time of 6:40pm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We first went to the only noteworthy
artistic monument of Shibuya, the Hachiko which is a famously loyal dog. There
was a line of like 10 people so she helped take a photo of me from a distance
rather than right beside the dog. Then we went to the original sushi place in
Seibu that we wanted but there were like 20 people in line so it was a
automatic NO and my eyes kept drifting to the Chinese restaurants HAHA thanks
to my strong attachment to my cultural roots and she’s like yes you should get
something Japanese. In that time we continued looking at random stuff like some
handkerchiefs with initials for her colleagues. They’re not cheap but oh well
useful and small</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=220 height=294
src="./image046.jpg" align=left hspace=12 vspace=12></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Update I did not buy because that’s too
expensive and I misconverted the currency. Also quote me: “(the Shibuya
scramble) it’s giving Times Square, but clean.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I also had to get green and purple seeded
plums for Enoch Li who texted me on Instagram about it heh. ¥341 total so it
was cheap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Ayumi
treated me to sushi!!! I was like split the bill in Japanese and she’s like
solemnly no this shall be my treat. Ayumi gave me a corn from </span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>茨城</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>ibaraki which is like the funniest thing
ever so I took a photo of her with the corn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Home at 9:14pm! As Kiko my landlord said,
this is really a quaint pretty quiet neighbourhood with a stark contrast to all
the hustle and bustle of Shibuya. So I love the night walk home and I can’t
wait to shower after hustling around Shibuya .</span></p>

<h3><a name="_3rdcrjn"></a><span lang=EN-GB>15-June-2023     Thursday ☔️        </span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hello</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>woke up early cuz of knocking noises at my
door, but I soon got back to sleep right before 8:00 a.m. and I completed a
cycle until it was like 10:19 am. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At 10:50 a.m. kikosan and Dominic came by
and knocked on the door upon which I let them in and we chatted a little bit
about life in Japan and her upcoming Stanford summer school. She was the kind
of girl that is rather bubbly and chatty and seems to be very sociable and the
kind of humanity's focused person who probably enjoys Dominic's emotional
support. And I realised that Dominic was wearing a Dri-Fit t-shirt that has
frog on it and I confirmed that he was part of the <a>elite naval diving unit </a><a

onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_30','_com_30')"

prestigious and almost life-threateningly difficult. Respect to the man. I also
decided to start boiling the corn that ayumi had given me last night and I told
them it was the corn from ibaraki and it started boiling and it smelled very
nice. Kiko remarked that in the 2 times she came back to get her belongings
like a phone and a bag. Also she commented on how nice the neighbourhood is and
asked why I didn’t turn on the aircon even though the day is hot upon which I
explained that the appliance was on for the whole night. I also updated her
that I ate one of his snacks chocolate thingies which I didn't enjoy bu<a>t I
was actually hungry enough to eat chocolate so she was like oh that's really
tasty and it's okay with me just eating a snack and there's a lot of chocolate
related snacks.. actually hungry.</a><a class=msocomanchor id="_anchor_31"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They started rummaging through their stuff
and Dominic helped me zip up one section of the mattress with the other two
sections. Dominic also had to find his passport which he did and they removed a
few bags and the big luggage from one of the upper sections which helped me to
free up space that I can live my luggage in. I felt a little bad that yiyi was
waiting for me to reply her message because I was asleep and then from 10:30 on
which I didn't know what she was doing. Updates: she actually fell asleep from
10:30 onwards and I think this is the best sleep she has had in a while and I'm
glad that we have less things to worry about then be<a>fore so that's a big w
for us.</a><a class=msocomanchor id="_anchor_32"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Actually udon this time!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It’s hot and I am waiting for it to cool

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I don't know if I slept too much or what
but I feel a tiny bit dizzy and I my stomach feels weird because I'm ingesting
food at a different time from all the previous days because I didn't have
breakfast and I went straight to lunch at 11:30 a.m. anyway I finally texted
Imani today at 12:20 p.m. and I asked him about the issue of having to pay for
specific data about Singaporean businesses because if we want to measure the
success of a Japanese business in Singapore then obviously they're not going to
give you the data for free right and then I share of him like a sample business
profile of what you can get if you pay like 5.5 Singapore dollars and he hasn't
opened my message yet but it's all right because he's a busy man. I'm thinking
if I should go out to different places while bring my computer and my phone to
hotspot my computer have already used like 1.4 gigabytes of my 10 GB plan so I
have to be a little more conservative in my data usage than I am now because I
have like a bit more than 7 weeks here. Also today I have to launch the discord
announcement of what I'm going to do on Union bridge and then I'm also going to
do a little bit of hsylc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Oh yes at 12:54pm I hear the doorbell. This
is always rare because I never hear neighbours and I never had anyone visit me
these few days nor knock on my door until this morning (might be a neighbour’s
thumping noises who knows). It was a delivery man in a blue cap who passed me a
box of rice that Dominic Doel Sob Jun Wei (Kiko’s boyfriend) had ordered. First
Japan delivery &#127471;&#127477; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It has been so long I gave Yiyi enough time
to talk and I’m glad remote work has given me the chance to do so. Very very
thankful. We first covered heavier topics of job and future plans and my own
family things, and how it led from the conversation with Jin, her alumni
interviewer. I found it cool that he asks for proof during the interview of the
activities especially when college applicants are heavily plagued by agencies
and also a lack of integrity. Shame. We then shifted to more light hearted
topics like my initial physical reactions to cuddling and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At close to 4pm I realise I have a meeting.
Before that I had a bit of stomachache and diarrhoea and carelessly put my keys
and wallet at the sink area and forgot I did that. Usually such digestive woes
arise when I eat at a different time compared to the habit I’ve built in the
previous few days — today waking up at 10:19am meant I skipped breakfast and
went straight to lunch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
rushed to </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>池ノ上</span><span

re-entering the house a couple of times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Bad
photo because he has nice eyes: Shimada </span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>島田社長　偉い人ですね</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He’s such a big man!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>So I
waited more than 20 minutes for him to be done with the phone conversation with
his client. My man is managing 7 or 8 different clients at the same time
(context: our junior consultants do 1, our managers do like 2 client cases and
obviously they’re tanking a lot but it’s a shit ton), working with 20 different
companies and also serving as board member of his alma mater (hitotsubashi </span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>一橋大学</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>) where he attends meetings fortnightly.
Man is an obvious extrovert with so much intelligence and success/ambition in
his eyes LOL. And he’s on the ground: I told him it’s </span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>光栄の至り</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> to meet him and thanked him using all
the fancy flowery Japanese for his valuable time (he said he has business
dinner every night). He showed me his visit to Singapore and the profiles of
the people he drank a lot of wine with — Prof Yeoh Khay Guan. CEO is likely to
be a 100% Extrovert given how many people he has to juggle at the same time. I
realise that people in the upper echelons of consultant are being paid for the
amount of socialising they have to do, compared to a junior who deals mostly
with the computer and his direct supervisor. The more people you manage, the
less you look at screens (</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>大野</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Ohno san is the secretary and
she’ll help you look at screens), and the more you talk to people. And your pay
grade would be great! So life gets better as you climb up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course as a Big Busy Man he has to leave
at 5:50pm but he did give me at least 30 minutes of his time and his attention
while I speak we had good eye contact &#128065;️ &#128065;️ He then praised on
my good use of Keigo</span><span lang=ZH-CN>敬語</span><span lang=EN-GB> such as </span><span
lang=ZH-CN>お忙しいところ恐縮ながら</span><span lang=EN-GB> like I’m extremely apologetic

either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Also
he asked about my life where I’ve been, my parents’ jobs </span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>機内食</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> basically aviation industry (obviously
if I’m from a elite background he might get more connections), any siblings I
have, what school I went to, where I stayed in Singapore. His younger son is 18
and went to BU before transferring to UChicago. Previously boarding school in
Newton. Older one was Public Health at UC Berkeley and also boarding school in
Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Evidently CEO is a fan of the American education
system which I confirmed. He switched to English a few times but I stuck to
replying him in Japanese, with a mix of a few words in English which he was
nice to translate for me. Such as </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:

else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I was hungry and my stomach is rumbling so
I’m going to take the train back to Shibuya or somewhere along the line. I
wouldn’t pay extra to go to Asakusa which is in the other direction and not

can go to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Apart from the usual shuffling along the

for ¥312 — quick math it was cheap for every bottle so I stuffed my Reischauer
black tote bag with them.The first one is the bigger pink one that’s ¥792, a
small blue one for me that’s ¥284 super cheap and a pack of 3 pens that’s ¥98
(probably the cheapest in the market). My back aches a little on the left
because all the weight is on my right shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So cheap at My Basket run by Aeon only
¥429. Better than family mart and 7 Eleven!! Also speaking of 7 Eleven, I only
just realised (when I heard some Caucasians use English to point this out),
that the top shelf actually HEATS up all the drinks like cappuccino and even
bottled water such that it’s all warm. I just realise how Japan THINKS SO HARD
as a country and maybe the brain use made everyone skinny: the coin trays
installed into every cashier counter so that your coins aren’t all over the
table, the little notes telling you to watch out for this and that and explain
why things are done a certain way, the genius cubicles for solo dining, the
genius little funnel above the toilet bowl for your waste water to be reused as
flushing water, meal serving machines and machines that allow you to press a
button and do everything without hearing any REAL PERSON. There’s so much
consideration and I was just thinking how selfless many workers are compared to
America. I mean being guilty seems to be core to existence, I can’t do anything
to remedy the situation and I can’t think to trouble anyone… </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Right
when I am about to enter the office building at about 1pm, the rain started! Weather
forecast said 12 noon so thank you for sparing me, dear Meteorological God, and
pushing the rain back by one hour. I met Je (Cheh?)-san who is the Korean
person and I’m glad I got the name right. I had a short conversation in which
we did our short introductions, and then I said in Korean jeo-neun hangungmal
bae-u-go-shippo-seo-yo or something like that, upon which she replied (in a
manner very similar to Alex Lim’s mother) that I spoke Korean very well. Also
she asked me if I’m half Japanese or something, I said I’m Singaporean, born in
China. Previously when I heard her talking to Anzai</span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>安斎　安齋</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> yesterday, I felt like she was already
quite like a native. But then I heard how she would pronounce the ‘z’ sound in
Japanese and it was very off (‘z’ sound should be like English but she did the
Korean aspirated sound like a “ch”). So Korean accent is revealed! And then,
after I opened the door and we entered the office together, I asked her for
what translation app she used and she said Pappago (double P for the staccato
sound) and that was the same as what most Koreans used. Then she quickly walked
back to her corner near the fridge and the microwave and the mugs and went back
to her work haha. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

Wada </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>和田</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> had also remarked. Today in
the morning I managed to write down all the company structure and the names of
people I had met on the first day which I will easily remember; in the afternoon
I finished copying all the things on the whiteboard about consulting, report
topic, economics stuff that </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>森本</span><span

night for the triple ballpoint pens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Arial Unicode MS"'>At 4pm I got hungry and then went for lunch part 2! While I
went to the microwave which is still situated within the office, Mr very fair
skin and sharp yet relaxed looking Anzai </span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>安斎</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> invited me for lunch, he probably
thought I wouldn’t be able to afford the meals here and that’s why I went to
convenience stores. I was like yes thank you for inviting (in keigo maximum
politeness fashion), I said should I use microsoft teams to check the calendar
and find a common time, and I forgot what he said. Before that, while I was
filling hot water at the water machine near the fridge, Mr </span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>浅井</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Asai, this very sincere and somewhat
handsome young dude who is a Senior consultant too also invited me to go for
lunch and I told him about my remote work plan for next week so hopefully for
both days where I’m back in office I get treated for lunch by these 2 people.
And on the side, get to know them a little bit. Update at 6:10pm • we’re having
a 3 person meal, I took a while to enunciate that I thought it’ll be 2 of us at
a time (2lunches) but nope it’s one lunch HAHA.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Back to my meal:
it was a beautiful set that I’d bought for about 500¥ with a long piece of
salted salmon with one chewable fish bone, one pyramid shaped konyaku jelly,
konyaku noodles, boiled carrot and boiled radish and this delicious Oden thing
that I don’t know what it’s made of but it’s chewy and savoury. I made the huge
mistake of dining in the smoking room. I inhaled 2nd hand smoke from the people
who entered and then felt my throat being rough and my head being a little
dizzy. I almost knocked over the bin for the cigarette ash in a bid to rush out
of the room; I should have left right when people had entered while I was
eating but I waited till I finished my entire bento box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I came back at 4:57pm; he has been
working with Fujimi and that sleek long fringe dude and another random dude.
And then the slightly red faced, Winnie the Pooh looking dude known as Masahiro
Araki who is the director. A lot of people in this small area today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Later
when I was refilling hot water for the eighth time at the Pantry, I met </span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>池本</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>-san or Ikemoto-san who belonged to the
back office, and obviously she doesn’t get as much pay or recognition as our
amazing elite consultants so we had a very genuine and warm conversation. She
asked if I was okay. She also asked which country I was before this and got an
idea of how I moved from China to Singapore to USA, and then recently departed
from China, and that I have never been to Japan before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I don’t really know how to go forward with
the market research so I’m gonna rest here at like 22 different companies for
the retail industry and an unknown like 50 names for the food industry for the
report task, and 0 progress for the second task about i freek mobile company, I
really don’t care if all their products fail it has nothing to do with me haha.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>There
were a lot of people still at 6:17pm in the office I was a bit embarrassed and
got up and down waiting for a cue and finally I got the cue which was asai </span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>浅井</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> senpai getting up from his seat so I’m
not like the first one. And soon after he got up I also got up to leave, making
eye contact with Kibe san whom I had asked if his body wasn’t feeling good and
he smiled and said he just had hanamizu </span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>鼻水</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> and it’s all fine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At 6:50pm, after walking back and forth
around the original gantries where I’d usually take the train, I took the JR
line </span><span lang=ZH-CN>有楽町線</span><span lang=EN-GB>yūrakuchō-sen from </span><span
lang=ZH-CN>銀座一丁目</span><span lang=EN-GB>Ginza icchōme to shintomi chō </span><span

lang=EN-GB>toyosu noting that Toyota is </span><span lang=ZH-CN>豊田</span><span

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> at exit 2b as we had agreed
upon, but slightly earlier at 7pm. We waited for Junxin’s daughter to finish
her K-pop dance lesson for like 20 minutes where we stood in the pleasant

style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>豊洲</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>toyosu station and chatted about
accommodations, people that Junxin knew in P&amp;E Directions and so on. Had a
pretty high class izakaya (</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>居酒屋</span><span

cold as usual, and somehow I don’t feel the need to sleep until 11am or
something since I slept for about 8 hours perhaps or less since I didn’t take
long to fall asleep. Yiyi is experiencing a lot more severe nightly menstrual
cramps than a month ago, partly because I did not behave appropriately and
showed a callous lack of empathy towards her pain last night at about 1:20am,

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>At 10am while</span></b><span

Instagram post about Harvard and his career plan, his little prophetic photo of
him holding a mathematique and a language certificate at 7 (and now at 22 he's
done with M.A. B.A. for linguistics and with a bit of mathematics and a music
secondary). Talent, passion and drive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At 11am I finally finished swing drying my

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Also after some digging around in my

we left Zhangpu county on Friday 9 June! I had squeezed them into a red plastic
bag and stuffed it to the bottom, and I spent a considerable time in Xiamen
looking for them but to no avail. It smells like stagnant water so I’m gonna
keep them outside the house first! But it’s not too bad there’s no sweat or
bodily odours. This only happened because I’m trying to recover my selfie

for the insane detail. Went to lunch with Michael Tan and we had an insane meal

popular belief!!) and my set of tempura don was 1200, totally worth it, while
his pork katsu don with soba soup was 1100 (3 bowls of carbohydrates for him

mobile carrier I use (SoftBank for me) and what my family uses (they are not in
Japan). I got a hyper thin notebook (just a few pieces of paper) and then I
picked like a bandaid. Then there was another button tapping game, right
outside the mobile products shop, where I am supposed to time exactly 10
seconds, after counting from a 3 second countdown after which there is a
counter in the machine that starts but I don’t get to see the seconds pass,
rather I just count inside my heart. I got a little ahead of myself in the
process and stopped at 9.04 seconds, hence not winning anything else. We moved
on to the streets including the capsule stations above gacha-gacha, and I also
went to a shoe shop that sold Nike, Adidas and other brands that are moderately

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>In
the morning, spent 5100¥ (pain) on the taxi unfortunately that took 30 minutes
to get me from sankakubashi </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>三角橋</span><span

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>. At least I wasn’t all
sweaty and uncomfortable. Where I waited indoors for a while and saw the Kyoto
tourism-promoting cardboard cutouts of the local statues, before realising that
the two newly met Jiaying and Ayumi are outside the station. I handed them the
two tiny cans of green tea with tominaga written on them that I got from the
workplace and apologised for being a whole hour late (Megan style).</span></p>

live in the corners of the house ~ I had to buy a cute keychain for Yiyi!!,
Pokémon, Harry Potter, Miffy, Snoopy and Peanut, Totoro, for like 1 hour
Lunchtime! I spent ¥1350 on a ramen with extra noodles and a rice that had jako
fish flakes that were too salty and I didn’t finish. It was very mid despite
the ratings that the shop had received. Anyway during lunch I finally managed
to hear the tea from Jia Ying about her roommate! She stays in a airbnb near
Asakusa</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>浅草</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> which we were at for most of
the day, with a guy and a girl who were her friends since year 1. Basically the
noise and lack of consideration of the girl made life a bit difficult. Jiaying
asked about what my girlfriend is studying, how we met, how old she is and
such.</span></p>

run out, oh well).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dinner was before 7pm — at Zenya which is
the restaurant that Jiaying found on Google maps that was rated 4.7 stars (!)
we had 8 tables before us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>We
were talking about the names of the different utensils in Japanese, at the
monjayaki </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>もんじゃ焼き</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> place known as “Zenya” where
we spent 4499 Yen in total (I had half of a ¥1580 mentaiko</span><span

style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>, Ayumi had a ¥1180 modan yaki without
meat which the restaurant messed up and it took way too long to arrive like 50
minutes). In total my dinner was probably only 1400 yen. Jia Ying also ordered
a ginger ale in a nice big beer mug. I asked about her boyfriend and how they
were coping with LDR! The guy whom I played badminton with before is too busy
with his badminton coaching and almost daily training as well as Sunday church
and preparation for that. Also the conversation turned to living and laundry
and I was surprised to learn Jia Ying’s mother made her hand wash laundry
because “washing machine wastes too much water”. Then the conversation focused
on the misogyny of their households in that males get a free pass NOT to do
chores and just sit back and enjoy having the women prepare stuff for them
(same conversation we had at Lê’s after returning from New York during
Thanksgiving).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We were hovering around Sumida Park </span><span
lang=ZH-CN>隅田公園</span><span lang=EN-GB>(kōen) which is right at Asakusa station 
and Ayumi mentioned her internship mentor whose also a member of Parliament!
The woman graduated from Georgetown and also did her masters in the US, and
told Ayumi that she sees herself in Ayumi, hence inspiring her to pursue
something policy and international relations related. She said that the woman
Eri almost had tears in her eyes cuz she was emotional. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At Sumida Park, we were just sitting
tiredly at the benches, and then I noticed some jellyfish floating near the
surface of the water.  Kurage! I said to Ayumi. She turned to Jia Ying on the
right cuz the stone bench could only fit 2 people (with a divider in between)
and Jia Ying was on the neighboring bench, and asked her about her interest in
animals etc and I said JY used to volunteer at a turtle &#128034; shelter in
Singapore (feed them, clean their shit, quote). Then we heard loud &#128266;
motor noises across the water</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>We
walked back to the same Asakusa street leading to Donki and I simply had to
take a phto with a sign below a roof that says </span><span lang=ZH-CN

style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> which sounds like Fujia!!!!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Before dinner, was at ROX shopping Center
including a bookstore and a ABC shoe mart and DAISO, tried to look for the book
that my cousin wants me to Mail from Japan to Shanghai.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>After
dinner, walked to Asakusa or </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>浅草</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> station and Ayumi shared
again about her father’s company that had released her mother from work and
also made him uproot himself to go other countries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jiaying said bye to us because she lived
around there. Walked down to the platform with Ayumi</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Reached

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Woke to my phone buzzing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Decided to roll myself up like a sushi
inside my blanket first — once again I had left the window open for the whole
night and that makes me a little cold despite the fact that I’m wearing a (too
small) pajamas shirt and Uniqlo heat tech pants. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
decided to heat my 538¥ thick large piece salmon bento (with bamboo shoot
pickle, carrot and idk what root vegetable and sushi wrapping) for 2.5minutes
first and continue lying down. Obviously I didn’t sleep enough because I lay
awake till after 1am. I thought about work and imagined myself (</span><span

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>being in the same house as
Fujia (how that would facilitate luggage packing and just giving stuff). I took
a dump and brushed my teeth, heated the water that I boiled last night and
drank it. Decided on a pair of blue pants that I’ve not worn to work before;
added the blue jacket to help me feel warm. Decided to eat while walking to the
station which worked out perfectly as I could dump the bento box and chopsticks
exactly at the shop (</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>まいますけっと</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> my basket by Aeon) at the
train station where I bought it from (I almost dumped it at a bin along the way
but there were too many people watching). There’s quite a bit of salmon bone
inside that chunk of meat! Some were discarded at the drains along the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Reached Shibuya at 8:15am!</span><span

humans!! So 1.9m tall dude sat down on my right and I saw that he’s watching the
original Japanese transformers or something like that. Then the incoming
commuters pushed so hard that the old and young women in front of me lost their
balance and stumbled. Then a second wave (much like the aftershocks of an
earthquake) pushed the poor 1.6m dude who clung on to the handrail and fumbled
for balance. Then the 1.9m dude on my right just casual pushed his big hand
against the 1.6m dude’s bag that he carried at the front, as confidently and
nonchalantly as anyone ever could. This all happened in complete silence, no
gasp or expression of dismay.</span></p>

been like 700yen or something). Needed a bit of help when he asked if I wanted

simply a tiny black rectangle, smaller than the average power bank. Decided to
rewear a Pforzheimer T-shirt in the washing machine since I’ll shower after I
get home. Walked out in shorts and slippers, thinking about Yiyi and decided to
open one of her karaoke songs, about galaxies and walking in the gentle evening
breeze.</span></p>

looking around where to sit and how to order (just using that conventional coin
and note automatic machine that every ramen shop has but I forgot).</span></p>

made a big purchase today from www.japan-wireless.com (managed to find a 20%
off discount coupon online, reduced the daily price from SGD6 to SGD4.58
because I simply cannot survive the rest of June with such shitty Wi-Fi at home
it’s pissing me off. Basically for the home portable Wi-Fi, it becomes unusable
(can’t call, can’t download anything, can’t play anything, message takes 30
seconds to send) when I exceed the limit of 100GB which is really dumb hahaha
because obviously the owner had been using a portion of that Wi-Fi before I
arrived. So yes extra topping up cost for the inadequacy of house house
appliances! Okay but I realise the rent I paid is really cheap so it doesn't
matter as much. Still a bit of heart pain having to pay for Wi-Fi! But I need
to remote work AND WATCH TWO BROKE GIRLS WITH YIYI AGAIN! SEASON THREE.</span></p>

explaining how this is allowed in Japan, where the establishments register
themselves as food &amp; beverage but in reality, the customers aren’t paying
for the food… they know what they’re paying for and there’s a menu for it. I
find it incredible that all these stuff coexist in Japan, the most civilised
and the most depraved and degenerate!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Love hotels were interesting because you
could “rest” in them or “stay” in them. Hahahaha</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I eventually picked matsuya because it’s
cheap and super effective (at filling my stomach) and relatively clean. Both
Michael and I ordered 2 sets each, I have 2 gyudon where one of them has radish

and Shaina also had a gyudon. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was so fun to walk around though and cuz

really plastic and gross. I mean obviously my attention wasn’t on guys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>My route for today: Ginza to Shinjuku via

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>松本真慧</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Meeting Andrew Yap for most of the day</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Started spending at Shibuya. ¥390 for A
pretty good pork and spring onion dawn that was also supplemented with a raw
egg which I only ate the yolk because I trust the hygiene of Japan. So I woke
up before that at 9:37 a.m. and I knew that I'm not going to make it to Shibuya
at 10:00 a.m. so I thought about what I should eat for breakfast I put a couple
of pineapple tart packets into my bag I brought my Wi-Fi and it's portable
charger as well as my iPhone only and the passport that was necessary to offset
the tax  because as a foreigner in Japan I can buy a certain amount of stuff
and then they will minus off the tax  for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What was particularly her worming about
this morning is that while I arrive at the counter I noticed that the cash is
from the night before it had already wrapped up all my stuff in the clear
plastic rapper with a note on it saying that the customer is going to come and
collect this items and I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to buy those items
that I really want just because they put them back in the shelf and then some
other customer had taken it but fortunately I was there at like 10:10 a.m. so I
was able to buy the sushi fridge magnets and the five books. With that I began
getting hungry so I decided to stop at this specific place called ekudo and
there were really cheap stuff there despite the fact that it was from location
right across a train exit. In addition I didn't want to be rushing Andrew and
his four friends for lunch because I would be extremely hungry and my stomach
will feel weird if I didn't have breakfast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After that I just have to use my monthly
pass and take the train down the orange line to reach ginza station and that
was where Andrew was shopping and he told me that his back was ripping apart
and he had to find a bag at Uniqlo. I remember to apply sunscreen because
today's ultraviolet index was a little bit higher than yesterday and I walked
to where Andrew was which is the 12th story Uniqlo  clothes store which is the
largest Uniqlo  store in the whole world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>There
I met Andrew's friends Ryan and Matthew. Matthew was studying with his sister
Crystal was also there in Melbourne and Ryan's sister Claire was also there. We
went about a few floors and then I hugged Andrew because I haven't seen him in
like 10 months and we were in Singapore at the same time in May but eventually
we didn't meet up and we talked about all sorts of stuff from what we've been
doing the past few months to what we feel about America to all the updates of
friends around us and how he met his gang of friends as well as upcoming plans
for Japan and also he taught me a lot about his mirrorless camera and he was
filled with gratitude that Blake lent him this 2600 camera to take great photos
and we eventually post along the street which is 5-chome</span><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>丁目</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> Ginza. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Spent ¥1000 topping up my card. Boo hoo I
entered and exited the GRANSTA of Tokyo  station because Andrew’s friend
Matthew needed something for his ankle that was feeling uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>¥5080  on books mostly for my cousin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>¥1100 on lunch </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>¥1980 on Yiyi gift yayy</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>¥680 on tiny milk tea times 2 and tiny
melon bread!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>¥600 and ¥500 on nuigurumi of gojo n Megumi
(Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 going to come out next week).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>oh
yeah I need to launch discord event for Unibridge, the initiative that my NS
friend </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>云正</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> who’s currently at Berkeley
and Lorraine who’s currently at LMU Germany are running. Lorraine has been
texting me about starting the event for Singaporean junior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>IF Donki was a visual assault, then
Akihabara is a audiovisual extravaganza (derogatory). The amount of Japanese
pop music and blatant adult things and anime merch and surprisingly lots of
second hand electronics! I felt a little sense of panic at the level of
degeneracy of Japan and the degenerate people visiting. Anyway, cuter stuff
like the sushi magnet, me happy making it home with all my belongings at 7pm,
cooking noodles while eating them with the leftovers from KBBQ yesterday while
Discord call, and Higashino Keigo not so nice handwriting! On the train. I was
so tired just sitting and stoning on the train.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Also I was praised for my t-shirt (by one
of Andrew’s friends) saying I embodies the yakuza vibe (Japanese black society)
and I shared where it’s from; also mentioned the neighbouring station having
vintage and thrift clothes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I was thinking about good looking people

their looks and the need for makeup. And I know that good looking people

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I walked in the throng of people, the
submissive herd of commuters, to the platform and moved down to a door where I
felt there were less people. I sat down at the last remaining seat in the

another short haired woman who wobbled her head left and right every 10
seconds, as if to suggest “what kind of society smh” as the commuters swarmed
in like rats. She was pushed by the crowd and swayed but stood at the same

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Hiiii</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>7:40am my brain was feeling like it’s in
a hangover. Wrapped myself in blankets until maybe 7:48am and went to heat up
the remains of that sweet and sour pork and rice that I packed from yesterday
lunch.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I just wanted to sleep for another hour

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Also need to throw out my combustible

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Entered Ikenoue at 8:15am</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Prepared for the meeting at 10am because
there’s a few market trends I did not find yesterday. (Or did not have the
heart to scour the Internet for). I filled hot water to cool it down. And saw
that my mentor sat opposite me (with a divider between us) and was feeling a
little apprehensive.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Was
whatsapping Cameron to arrange for the time and location to meet. Took a leaf
off the Anzai and Asai book and went back to Yorokobi </span></b><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>So we met serendipitously at the
crossing over to the restaurant (well not exactly but I was previously worried
about losing contact with Cameron because my WhatsApp isn’t on the phone with
data, and then I spotted him coming in from the left).</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>We had a very good catchup where we
mainly talked about his Cambridge housing and Harvard housing. They had a cool
system whereby in 2nd year they choose the rooms one by one, and it’s random
order BUT in order to counteract the inherent unfairness in ordering, they will
REVERSE the order of choosing in their 3rd year. We just talked about all the
people we knew from school from Xianli, Kenneth, Chunzhe, Jiahao, Goh Zhijie,
Jeffrey, Loi Si Xian, Megan and all these random names I haven’t heard in 3
years. He has a pretty cushy scholar life lined up for him where his PhD is
sponsored and he gets allowance every month. And he’s enjoying life and asking
if I’m gonna be back in Singapore, I said I’ll be in China (where my heart ❤️
is). Oh well. We talked about classmates who’d had to renounce their permanent
residency to avoid National service in Singapore and whether they could step
foot in Singapore. (Likely yes.) there is a bit of wistfulness and nostalgia
about our secondary school class. And Cameron might come to Harvard next year
for the PREIS research program or something because his college is the only one
that has such an arrangement with Harvard. Also talked about security issues on
campus where tourists and external people are involved..</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
think today was one of the best days of work because I felt like I contributed.
Previously it was purely excels and my own little compilations on Google doc or
PowerPoint and it was in a mess and my motivation was really low. Today
although I’m kind of sleep deprived, I was made to just have a hour long
meeting with Mr </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>村上</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>M who’s I guess lower
rank than all the other mentors, and work on the same PowerPoint, based on all
the information I collated yesterday about Japan whisky and sake
companies/exports and whisky market in China and specifically premium whisky
from Japan. (And all the other subsets of alcohol.) it’s not like the content
is super fun but I got to learn about all the big and small brands and how they
taste so this kind of piqued my interest in trying out some of these fruity
flavoured whiskies! That have hints of banana mango strawberries and whatever.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
think it’s just that I feel not alone with a mentor doing the same thing as me
and being always beside me to answer questions. Previously, I’d be assigned the
stuff and I’ll be all polite and yes-sir but soon I’ll lose steam. For today,
we actually have a product we are showing to the CEO (cuz he got an email from
an Adeline Chia in Singapore about potential whisky/sake</span></b><b><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>日本酒</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> business opportunities in

PRETTY SATISFYING to use the align tools that M </span></b><b><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>村上</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> taught me last time, to
align the alcohol bottles and the text and everything and make sure spaces are
justified. And also me using amazing tools like WeChat photo I can directly
select the word rather than putting it into a word reader, and this plot
digitizer which helps me read a graph in a report uploaded by </span></b><b><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>申港证券</span></b><b><span

made my first CAGR bar graph haha it was truly satisfying to finally use
thinkcell. Maybe PowerPoint work creates more beauty than excel. Front end
(thinkcell) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back end (excel). </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I

(I become insanely efficient in doing these stuff when I’m working with a
mentor right beside me because he’s also working on slides, though he had moved
on to a different one.) based on some of the stuff he wrote, I realised that
some content was kind of redundant and so I did not keep everything he wrote.

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Also incredible my iPhone remained at

bustling!! Saw a new bookstore I haven’t seen before. Anyway it became hot
really fast. A restaurant called Stamina with meat and rice buffet caught my
attention. Perhaps I will try one day. I saw that Shao Chi and this kinda sharp
nose kinda Malay looking guy called Rhys were going to eat the grilled meat.
Luckily the shop could seat all of us; they had a confusing process where we’re
supposed to self collect the meal and meat and rice from the window but we just
didn’t get the notification on the tablet so they had to shout for us to go and
get it. Shao Chi was always nice to get it.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Spent
¥1320 on dinner hmm. At least I had a student deal! Also this is separate from

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Of course there’s so rice so I have a

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I

eat until </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>腻了</span></b><b><span

had singaporeans on my left (one of them had lived in Boston for a year when
she was young). Then Michael, Rhys and Cheryl went to Donki while Brian took the
Tokyo Metro and I took the Japan Rail to Shibuya and back home.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Insane insight from Shao Chi was that he

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='color:#6AA84F'>Meeting Andrew Yap
again in the afternoon. We might tentatively go to Shimokita.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>So today was very interesting. We
actually spent some time sitting in the bookstore which is near the train
station and I spent ¥740 yen on a comic book that was for my cousin in
Shanghai. And then we went from the bookstore to this place called Fuji soba
which basically sold like soba noodles and katsudon and pork curry and that
sort of thing. So I talked about Jay Hong and then Andrew started talking about
his parents and there were a lot of stuff that have happened that I haven't
heard him talk about before and we were like pretty much 100% honest with each
other about like stuff happening within our families and like you know you know
things that happen in high school that we might not tell other people that
happened. And then we were supposed to meet his four other friends back at the
daiso shop and the foreign friends were named Claire Matthew Ryan and Crystal
but eventually some of them wander off to get clothes from Uniqlo and then me
and Andrew were like we're not going to buy anymore clothes for spend enough so
we went from that lunch place down the street to ABC Mart and by the time it
was raining a little bit and we had also taken a few photos using the expensive
camera and Andrew was nice to pick up something that one with the process by
had dropped so we would taking photos against the the arch that had a specific
sign that was labeled Shimokita shopping street.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I think by this time his whole group was
really tired they went from Kyoto to Osaka and then from Osaka to Kyoto and
then they cycled under the hot Kyoto's son two days ago and then this morning
they woke up early to go to team lapse which is a specific attraction in Tokyo
that has water and you have to wade through the water.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>So actually this bunch of people are
probably really exhausted and have a little bit of heat stroke from their
experience traveling in Kyoto and moving around between so many cities of Japan
so actually the rest of Andrew's friend group which he met from church they all
headed home at about 4:00 p.m. so that leaves me and Andrew and I was just
picking my shoe and then all the black shoe sizes was too small and those were
the only pairs left in the store and then I came upon this shoe that was like
5489 yen and that was a really good price for a nice gray Adidas show so
eventually I settle on this gray color even though it might not go where very
well with my work outfit but I think I'm going to try wearing these pair of
shoes to work and also wearing it just to hike around and I eventually bought
the shoes but it was so close to text exemption but I think they purposely made
it such that it was slightly less than the tax amount so I couldn't get tax
exemption which would have given me like a cheaper price but it's fine.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>So after 4:00 p.m. Andrew and I walked
back directly home from the shopping area which is only about 1 km away and
then we took some photos around the way and then I just share with him the beauty
of Japanese architecture and we talked about all sorts of random stuff and
about like his upcoming trips and then I also asked him if he could help me
bring my mom's jeans back to Singapore which I had accidentally kept in my
luggage on the day she had covid and we were packing on stuff back from china.
And then I stood outside my apartment while Andrew sat inside the apartment
with the air conditioning because I talked to my Yiyi. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>And then Andrew and I played at least 10
meters of ice rage which is our go-to game and which is a game we have played
already in four different countries you know in these four specific different
contexts and then I was debating between eating Japanese food or Chinese food
for dinner and Andrew prefer Japanese food so we went to that place I had told
him about that I had already gone to like three times in the place I have
visited on my first day and we ordered this thing that caused 1,100 yen which
is the set of katsudon and sober with soup and that was something that I know
was going to taste decent but it does not have as much vegetables as what I can
get with the Chinese food restaurant so that's the place I will visit tomorrow.
From the restaurant we actually took some amazing photos of the street view
such as a case of vending machine in case the traditional Japanese lantern and
of the train tracks and we were standing by train chase and I got a few good
shots in some of which I think we're good for like profile pictures because the
camera was so high quality and they were moments where we were taking photos
well cars were trying to pass through or like the red light was signaling that
the train is going to come and run over the train tracks and we're like take
take the focus really fast and eventually we escaped to the side of the train
track I feel the need to use the bathroom and then we went to use the bathroom
inside the train station and also I had to check if my mom's jeans were
actually hers so Andrew had to dig through all the contents of his back and
take it out I was sorry to trouble him but I took the photo and verified with
my mother that it is her specific pair of jeans and after that and he continued
to tell me about the apologetics that he has been doing research on and I told
him about the case for Christ book by Lee strobel that Amanda we had given to
me so that was something he wanted me to read and then we also talked about
like usage of certain online media and its effects on the brain and religious
as well is not religious views towards bodily communions. We actually passed by
the Chinese restaurant that I really liked but we decided not to get a second
set so we only got one set for both of us which made me end up eating sesame
biscuits at home. Overall today I'm satisfied with my purchase of the shoes and
of the 550 Katsudon  in Japan.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I wake at 6:30am, saw the sun bright and

I drifted comfortably back to la la land. Woke and tossed around for 10 minutes

potato/broccoli/carrot/radish/black seafood thingy</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hide my keys and hope that no one else
takes them. I arrive at Ginza at 8:55am when the meeting is supposed to start

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Retroactive recording of what happened on
Tuesday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On the way to Ueno, I found this
all-you-can-eat Yakiniku buffet place called Stamina Next!</span><b><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>￥</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>2064 buffet lunch </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>with a time limit of 90 minutes, which we eventually exceeded by 15
minutes because Mr Lam Cheng En Joel Jerome Tan Kah Jesus Kee Christ was
getting matcha ice cream, shaved ice with an assortment of syrup, square cakes
and all sorts of desserts. On the other hand, I recognise that oranges have
fibres and vitamins so I took 2 plates of sliced oranges! I finished off most
of them while Selwyn and Sean took maybe 1 or 2.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We spent the time before and after lunch
mostly just walking around the Ameyokoya Shopping Street, where Chinese snacks
and barbecue skewers were disproportionately represented.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><img border=0 width=152 height=202

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then towards the evening we drifted from
Ueno to Akihabara. We did a good round at the park in a beautiful sweater
weather where I didn’t break a single sweat:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I seemed to have become the travel guide
but there were many questions they asked about specific landmarks that I could
not answer haha. I just randomly found a ramen restaurant not too far from the
Mcdonald's/Big Camera building that we entered; it was called Bankara Ramen
which had many outlets and there were many maid posters plastered by the door
with their signatures and with mementos that they had left behind. I saw a set
that was exactly </span><b><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>￥</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>1000 and </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>i bought that because it has both ramen and rice. And I was
pleasantly surprised to see that the ramen came with 2 chunks of meat, rather
than just one!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Woke at 7:16am and Sean somehow awake asked
me if I’m late for work. I said no my alarm hasn’t rung yet. It was getting
cold with the air conditioning. I had previously set the aircon to 25°C on
dehumidifying mode, but Selwyn got hot at maybe 1:30am and also could not stand
Joel’s snoring and reverted to the same sleeping configuration I used with Sean
on the bottom mattress (my feet at his head instead of both heads aligned
together).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I saw the same milky ginger short hair cat

stretching my hand forward in a friendly gesture. It hovered around the glass

the cat’s head!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Okay! I decided to walk to Three Kon

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We went to eat sandwiches and have drinks
at Three Kon Cafe. I spent about ¥731 on my chicken/potato salad sandwich,
strawberry cream and &#129373; cream sandwich (¥250 pre tax) and my caramel
milk tea which was more like creamy Hershey syrup coffee that was way too
sweet. Well. One of the most amount of processed sugar I’ve had in a while, I
remarked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>We mentioned our secondary 3 and 4 life and
Selwyn being the ever candid and honest dude talked about how coming from a
class 1E 2E that is branded as being not as smart, Simon and Austin from 1L
were his first friends and he missed us sitting together in a row of 3 at the
back. I do recall that it’s really fun and back in 2016 when we first met we’d
play games like Clash Royale and Pokémon Go when it was first released.</span></p>

outside of Harvard, apart from the pre-college meetups which were not really
official.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Before that, I decided to buy an Oppo pad

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I eventually got it for around ¥35500
because it was tax free! Amazing! )update: my mother did not think so and said
I should have bought it in China. My girlfriend also found the prices to be
much better in the Chinese market.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Being another hot sunny day, I purchased
the usual ¥74 2 liter bottle of water from My Basket, one of the best
convenience stores and that is a 6 minute walk from my accommodation.</span></p>

academic advisor of Ayumi and a whole bunch of Harvard kids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The event is going to be held in the
evening. Keidanren literally translates to economic groups association. It
should not be too far. I hope there is good food since it has an entrance fee
of 5000 yen per person for non-Harvard affiliates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Out of boredom and an intense desire to
fall asleep in this meeting room in Marroad Karuizawa, I decided to give name
for all the consultants in this company. Taiwanese Huang: Gudetama cuz she
looks a bit like Gudetama. Then Sagawa will be one of the face masks at a
temple. And then Suzuki is the dude from Ratatouille - Linguini, mixed with a
rat. Then Katsuzaki Tomotaka will be Lee Chong Wei, skinny dude. Or another
rodent. Then I is Tom Cruise cuz handsome. M will be Moon emoji.
Shimizu kind of has a underbite and always dresses and styles hair like a
village-born tycoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They ran out of budget or something because
it was such a stark contrast from yesterday. It felt like a school camp where
we had an assortment of packaged bread which were remnants from the morning,
and the main course being 2 onigiris&#127833;one that was sour preserved plum
flavored and another one that was some kind of anchovy and fragrant leaf flavored
as well as some tiny pieces of black and white preserved radish. This is
probably one-hundredth the one-patron price of the kinds of meat and dessert
and alcohol that we had last night in Ogosso. During this very pathetic meal, I
had a chat with Uda</span><span lang=ZH-CN>卯田</span><span lang=EN-GB>-san the
handsome Merger &amp; Acquisition specialist who has rosen to the Manager role
about how he met his wife and married her 11 years after they met - they
actually went to the same high school and knew each other by name, but only
became closer and eventually fell in love during classmates reunion! Meanwhile,
Morimoto-san</span><span lang=ZH-CN>森本</span><span lang=EN-GB> didn’t partake
in any conversation I had with people near him - there was a kind of
awkwardness in the air and I couldn’t talk to him much for very long. He was in
charge of a segment during the meeting where he would call upon random
employees like </span><span lang=ZH-CN>黄</span><span lang=EN-GB> from Taiwan</span><span
lang=ZH-CN>高雄</span><span lang=EN-GB> and on Anzai his Tokyo University same
faculty to answer questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After that it was golf competition:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
got 41 points. When we were nearing the hole at course 5, I saw it was 4:57pm
and about an hour from Shinkansen so I asked Horii a nice dude to call the
coach Iguchi </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>井口　誉</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> and we decided quickly to
end  because we’re not gonna get through the 6th course let alone the 9th one.
I also got closer to the guy I met during dinner who loves replying banally in
a way that was like Yang Yi: his name is Horii</span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>堀井</span><span lang=EN-GB

whether I need time to shower and stuff; I would rather not and return to Tokyo

intensive sport anyway. Edit: kinda intense if you do like 18 holes or 9 holes
in the hot sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
spent most of the time in the golf course with Sagawa-san</span></b><b><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>佐川 嵩徳</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>takanori on the left. I have
thought of many ocean creatures and cartoon characters but I think I will not
be mean because he is truly a likeable fellow and I had good conversations with
him. He kind of emanates a bit of sadness though - I asked if he had kids while
we were waiting at the shelter about to set off and he said he didn’t. I asked
about his Shinkansen train returning time for the day and he said pretty late -
past 10pm - and we also found common ground on the terrible idea of waking
early: in fact he paid for his hotel rooms, specifically to avoid gathering for
the early train on Friday morning (he stayed in Apa Hotel which is the other
one that the company had booked for employees), and has been in this town since
Thursday night. I asked him about the specifics of his chemical engineering
research back in college when he was studying in Minnesota: he mentioned how
the interactivity of micelles which are these spheres or whatever things coated
in the phospholipid bilayer - hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers - can
basically take different shapes based on what solvent you put them in and if
you measure the degree of hydrophilicity and hydrophobia of these solvents, as
well as the micelles. So I mentioned the concept of 4D printing which describes
a 3D structure that can change its shape over time to fit different functions.
Kind of interesting but definitely not something I would spend my youth months
in the lab trying to study! I asked why he did not continue with Masters degree
(which is the norm for his friends) and also go through with the PhD track that
he was so well-equipped and all set up for - he of course wanted to start
earning money. And consulting pays better than research assistant work for
sure. I think we talked yesterday lunch about the liberal arts education. His
English is better than most employees but we switched back to Japanese once his
little ramble about his thesis subject of micelles is over. Also, he expressed
sincere desire to drive the golf cart and I let him drive most of the way, and
focused more on taking photos on my phone and sending Telegram bubbles of me
being at this golf course. Yesterday on Friday, I already had taken my
opportunities driving the golf cart through the tunnel and all that. Not gonna
lie, I did exclaim and let out gasps when he speedily charges for the cart in
front, and then jammed the brakes in the nick of time. Also at 5pm, he wanted
to overtake the carts in front of us driven by </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>安西 空，森本和人</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> and others, but the slope was so
insanely steep and I feared that he almost toppled the cart. The golf coach had
to instruct him repeatedly to return to the Fairway path. I’m like haha you are
truly even more risk-inclined than me sir.</span></b></p>

was thinking about paying for that either using a credit card which had been
using which is most like a MasterCard that has a debit account that I can top
up anytime I want but eventually I was like let me just use the IC card which
is what Andrew had given me which is what this guy called hashimoto had given
to Andrew so that basically reduced the original value in the car to like 30
yen or something like that and it was basically empty after I use part of it to
buy the drink because it feels like oh it is something that the Japanese do the
engine you left behind and then I can just use a bit of that money inside so.
After that we met the ultra fat man who was going to sit at a Independence seat
on the train and later I thought about it and I thought that was the most
logical decision because if he had spent extra money choosing a specific seat
his fats will spill over to the seat of the neighbor beside him and then you
get complained and so if he chose a seat that is so called free sitting then no
one would choose to sit beside him and then he'll get two seats to himself

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I went to the bottom of the bowl and

not cheap and definitely balances the fish taste well, the light scent of
bonito flakes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The last specks of the soup had the texture
of grounded pork bone but it tasted more like bonito fish I guess. Also, I
really appreciate the spice of the onions and the blandness of the spinach to

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>On this sunny morning that marks the end
of my hosting chapter for a while, I woke up twice before the actual alarm
rang.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I think mainly because the Sun was very
bright in my face. It felt so good to continue sleeping when I saw Selwyn’s
phone show 5:35am which is 2 hours before my scheduled wake up time. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Then I woke up again past 6am. Saw the
time via Selwyn’s shattered Huawei Nova 5T and then went back to sleep. Woke at
7:35am and kept snoozing the alarm. My alarms rang at least 5 times and woke
the others up; the fumbling noise I made at the ledge holding my luggage and
the crinkling noise of the plastic wrapper around my collared shirts continued
to keep them awake.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Seeing that the boys were about to leave
I thought of what they could help me bring to Singapore. Sean was watching
baseball after he’d been woken up (he flipped around and I put my right foot on

chocolates into his carry-on bag, which he agreed to but noted he’d need to
check if he has enough space. Sean then started seeing the options for bringing
his long baseball bat on the flight — I found that you cannot carry on — and so
he borrowed my YouTrip card again (yesterday he borrowed to buy a 11000¥
baseball jersey) to buy about 69SGD worth of check-in luggage for sports
equipment. Luckily he’d topped up 250SGD in my PayNow earlier before so my card
still has money!</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I packed all the above items into Sean’s
baseball bat cardboard box which is quite funny because he never intended for
such a big burden to be brought back and that was an impulsive decision. But
the space between his baseball bat and the oblong cardboard box allowed me to
fit those clothes and the seal soft toy inside. Big win because a little bit
less luggage to bring back to Boston. </span></b></p>

that, on my way home, I dropped by “My Basket” to buy a bento meal set. I
hesitated and pondered between the one I had yesterday with mackerel, pork,
brocolli, half an egg, radish, cannot... versus the </span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>幕の内弁当　まくのうち</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>bento and settled for the second option,
which has a piece of salmon and 2 prawns and so there is a little bit more
seafood which I love. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They are very very commercialised and it
was quite wholesome, the chef brought us fans with Gyu-katsu Motomura. And
there were also bookmarks. They have an instagram and I think they have a very
good global presence. That’s why all the waiting times were above 60 minutes.
And there were many foreign tourists. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It’s such good weather to dry clothes but
so much UV ray outside! Sunscreen time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lunch at Hayabusa Ramen¥990 i inserted into
the machine a thousand yen note. Also I brought the flyer that would allow me

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>After
lunch, I found a place opened by a Japanese man - CLARIS bookstore, with lots
of Western music and records by The Carpenters and all that sort. I I then
proceeded to spend</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>　</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>¥300 on secondhand copies of
the following three books, 2 of which are by authors I have read the books of
before but in Chinese or English (</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:
"Arial Unicode MS"'>东野圭吾的假面饭店</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>).
The profit margin must be either 0 or negative which is quite unbelievable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
browsed a lot of books from Edo era such as the </span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>江戸乱歩えどらんぽ　</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>and depictions of brothels in that era,
as well as a huge picture book detailing post-war Tokyo with 20cm long graphs
spanning 2 pages, of how agricultural decreased and the banking industry and other
things like consumption of energy changed over time. Everything must have been
20-30% of the original marked price, which is incredible.  Eventually I found
this book which looked very very familiar! It must have been sold in
Singaporean chic bookstores for 3 to 5 times the price it is sold here! And
considering the depreciation of the yen, or </span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>えんやす</span><span lang=EN-GB

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>i’VE
always been a fan of the lovely Japanese food like ajisen ramen and </span><span

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> fro m childhood.So it is
finally my pleasure to spent</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>　</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>¥800 buying this book written
by a Japanese chef that talks about seasons offerings, cooking styles (all
light and dainty) and utensils. Here is what it is called.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><img border=0 width=118 height=161
id=image32.png src="./image317.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Shimokitazawa is just full of such gems,
though the other merchandise are extremely expensive. These are like books
almost in mint condition and it is truly incredible how much discount there is
on their pricing. Previously, I went to other bookstores and thought for highly
acclaimed authors the pricing would be the same if not more expensive than
other countries, but this amazing secondhand bookstore filled with love proved
me wrong. These are all famous books that have been sold out on some platforms,
also preserved with care and sometimes laminated by the owner to protect it,
and somehow it is so insanely cheap, perhaps because business has suffered in
the past few years and that’s why the owner pushed down the price. So
altogether I made 2 purchases with my youtrip card.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There is also the sports store with a
swimming pool and a gym and there was a 500 yen experience fee. I plan to come
again next time I really want a swim. Probably not I guess. After all these I
went back to the good old trust Ikenoue convenience store known as My Basket
and got a ¥74 pure water as I always do. THe 2 liter bottle. Though it does add
a little bit of trouble having to gather up all the plastic bottles into one
big plastic bag and my supply of that is slowly running out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dinner was with Ishikawa Chihiro </span><span
lang=ZH-CN>石川智尋</span><span lang=EN-GB>, Peng Bozhen and Ōno Tasuku from
Ōsaka!!!! Hayabusa Ramen again followed by a mid Izakaya where we had sesame
balls, a alcohol (I chose black sugar Japanese sake), and a restaurant special
which is lotus root sandwiching prawn. We had good talks. Chihiro is from
Harvard class of 2023 but she also did her Master's in either East Asian
studies or sociology and she is currently living with her sister in asakusa but
soon after that when she gets her own single apartment she's going to move out
further north and work at a journalism or rather a news company in Tokyo.
Tasuku on the other hand is here in Tokyo to help manage and give out questions
for the international physics Olympiad for which this man had gotten a gold
medal for many years back and he's actually a current sophomore so from the
class of 2025 and he is extremely famous in the Harvard physics circle and he
has never stopped doing research even during turn time and I asked him about
the specifics about the sort of materials and solid state physics that he's
investigating and he told me that specific wavelengths of life like for example
green light when shone onto a sheet of diamond can cause the electrons to do
something which I forgot he told me something about the lithium or whatever
that thing is. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At night, 10:39pm, I first decided to buy
the classic protein rich bento that I would always get from the classic My
Basket convenience store that is a mere 7 minutes walk from my house. It cost <b>¥430</b></span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> and is packed with very
saucy and ginger stir-fried pork, a nice chunk of grilled mackerel fish, a bit
of broccoli, half of a thankfully fully cooked flavoured egg, a small paper
bowl of kombu which is a form of Japanese seaweed and combined with flavoured
tofu puff and tiny bit of sliced carrots and a small scoop of mashed potato.
The name of the product was </span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>焼きさばと豚肉生姜焼きバ</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>At
night, 22:41, I spent ¥172 on an apple from </span><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>青森　あおもり　</span><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>that received a 30% discount because an
edge of it was bruised or something. It was blackened but not in an unpleasant
way.</span></p>

is called </span><span lang=ZH-CN>中央・総武線</span><span lang=EN-GB>chūō sōbu line
which is the yellow one I’ve never taken before. Then I tried to top up my IC
card that Andrew had passed me but apparently it’s attached to the Keiō line so
everything was a mess. Ended up being 30 minutes late to the party but it’s
okay everything went fine.</span></b><img width=129 height=1

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Dinner
was inside this building called Bito Akiba where there was a line of like 20
people waiting for the elevator, so I took the stairs to the 5th floor where
the restaurant chano-ma is. I was a bit more drawn to the lunch menu which had
beef rice and all that, but no matter. Eventually at 6:50pm I know the others have
been waiting and so I ordered prawn rice (little did I know there were 2 types,
one is Japanese doria which Jiayu labelled as </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>焗饭</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> and the other one was a cute little pot
of rice with simple prawn and sliced mushroom and a single grey-green curry
leaf that turned out to be unchewable). It was about 50% more expensive than
the actual western style rice but no matter, the bowl was bigger and I took my
time to finish it. There was so little topping and it was so bland that I was
only left with this slightly oily rice at the bottom. But I worked through it
unlike some others who finished their rice super fast.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Supposed to be 6:30pm. Dinner with
Japanese class including Nakazato!</span></b></p>

supreme masterchef and he actually buys his own raw salmon and marinades it
overnight in miso sauce and makes his own bento. I was very tempted to say that
he would be a good Japanese mother making bento sets for his children but then
I decided to withdraw that thought because it wasn’t super appropriate. Because
our teacher is such a good conversationalist we managed to talk for pretty long
about all sorts of different countries and people’s relationships and our plans
bla.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>We finished off with dessert &#127848;
which was ice cream and caramelised banana on top of a fluffy pancake! (</span><span

people). That was super cute.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Only
3 were left at the end. Shaina Michael and I went around Akihabara for a short

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Woke at 9am and then decided to sleep more,
then woke at 9:48am and saw I’s message at 5:22pm yesterday. Big oof. I

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>I had to escape from the cigarette smell it
was way too strong. Also I held too many stuff including my computer and phone
and dropped a couple of sandwiches onto the floor. Luckily an old lady with
short dyed hair reading the newspaper was very kind and nice to help me..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>This
elderly couple opening that restaurant called </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>三友轩</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> is really wholesome. The cleanliness of
the toilet reminded me of that episode of South Park entitled Japanese toilets
(which featured very accurate Japanese by Randy S. Marsh) and Chris Perez and I
had a good laugh over that.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>When I was at home there was a kind of
spiralling feeling. Like my brain’s emotional Center was collapsing unto
itself.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I came across Ocean Vuong’s “On This
World We’re Briefly Beautiful” book today  in my Google drive while looking for
a folder containing my mother’s photos as she will turn 50 years old in a month
— the distance between the hunter and the prey. And the description of a buck
head mounted in a restaurant in Virginia. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I also told mother about S**n and his
family woes.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
remember the day Tan-san MIT ‘23 was here, we took the train from Shibuya back
home and we were talking about all the different Japanese names such as
yamashita</span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>山下</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> meaning the person’s
ancestor is born under a mountain… and then interesting train station names
like The Water of Tea or </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:
"Arial Unicode MS"'>おちゃのみず</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Also how is the train for like less than
10km charging me ¥345 that’s a whole meal bro! Bro! </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>At 6:33pm, I am on my way to Toyosu.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Gym from 7pm-8pm. Arms shoulders legs.
Carried 20kg dumbbells on each hand for the first time and did some lunges.
Luckily I didn’t do it on hard floor but rather on the mat so my knees get
cushioned when I squat down.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Afternoon was a tiny bit of editing data
followed by course selection. I called my mother for a total of almost 50
minutes. It was a bit of discussion over my brother and his classes and stuff
to help me bring to Japan. And me updating on stuff I’m doing and might do. And
Yang yi Andrew Blake Joel gang meeting in Singapore!</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Decide to go Toyosu to hit the gym! I
was dilly dallying partly to charge my phone a bit more and partly because I
needed the closure from I replying to me via Microsoft teams.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB><img border=0 width=299 height=223
id=image518.jpg src="./image335.jpg"></span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>This is another cute station
close to my house! Last night after buying the ¥600 Wendy’s chicken burger I
did not want to risk walking home from here however today I might. Since taking
the big road down to this station is quite straightforward. This is only my 3rd
time at this station but it’s more well connected to Shinjuku and Hibiya </span></b><b><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>日比谷</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> and all so for my remaining
time in Japan I might take this private line more.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>And maybe try the food there that Andrew
highly recommended.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually after the gym, I could not
find any crab leg place that I really wanted (I’ve been watching youtube shorts
of this guy raw marinating seafood and then eating them raw!) so I settled for
the teppanyaki as per Andrew’s recommendation, but then the dinner price was
higher than lunch so I decided to save a little bit of money (not a lot
actually) and go to a random place called Yamaya, to order beef  “hormone” or
extremely fatty and tough to chew intestines. The rice portion was so pathetic
I had to get another bowl and it was also extremely small.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>This is a lunch place that i had
stumbled upon in Ginza 9, just a week ago. It looks wonderful and had a wide
variety of what seemed like authentic Japanese set meals and my main goal is to

before such as a new breed of fish.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
finally tried out the set meal lunch where I could get extra extra rice for
free! (Normally my previous experiences entailed just slightly more rice, but
today for lunch I got a whole atomic bomb bowl of carbohydrates that will
definitely delay my hunger till after 7pm!! This fish that I ordered was
something I have not tried in Japan before; so were the 2 fried oysters which I
had seen sell for a much higher price outside, like double the price of what I
got here. A bit more about the fish </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN

it has a denser saltier flavor. And it costs slightly less on its own. I would
order a different fish next time but that’s just my individual preference. In
the time I spent waiting, i read through a wechat article about a freelance
author in China who had wandered through mountains and Hong Shan Zoo and worked
with coroners and police and dead bodies, so that she can write novels (and
escape from office politics and being coerced into social situations). She
likes being an observer instead of being a participant.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I finished the meal at about 13:25.</span></b></p>

of the few times I did not eat red meat for lunch! White meat is better!</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>At
about 3:40pm, Feng Shan Shan (the Cantonese employee who’s super honest about
this company and quite an interesting person) said she will treat me to milk
tea!! A little celebration and my joy must have shown on my face and then she’s
like it’s nothing like something she should have done. Anyway I had a good
understanding of why she left the company she had worked at for like 3 years
(it was Nissan and she had a French supervisor actually). And she talked about
her breaking out of her comfort zone which I respect, and the way big old
established corporations like Nissan reduce the actual wage to the employees to
reduce tax, but more than make up for it in the form of housing subsidies and
food stipends, such that she believes that (having moved to the more central
part of Tokyo) the benefits were about the same. As a junior consultant only in
this company for 6 months, and as a 3 year employee at Nissan doing liaison and
email and other communications work, both had around the same pay but she said
she is definitely not experiencing </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>幸せ</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> shiawase at this point in time. She has
to ask everyone and also this company is extremely confined to Japanese
thinking; it’s probably 95% Japanese and although she says that it is not made
explicit or anything, there is this implicit air or atmosphere that the
Japanese way is the correct way (I mean such a method is the only way these
workers knew how to operate for their whole life since a lot of them have not
been in any multinational or very international companies, even if some of them
had lived overseas for a few years).</span></b></p>

emotionless as usual. He seems to be genuinely affectionate and never irritated
though i would not know. Also he gives a loud guffaw when I make an interesting
remark, such as how due to the fact that he is using programming to do
optimization of logistics for a transport company (A trucks to B locations,
what sort of distribution of routes is the most optimal?) I thought he should
get a pay raise, and he’s like HAW HAW (similar to the time last week during
meeting with him when I gave an anticlimactic answer of uhh I haven’t really
heard about Green finance in Singapore /  when we were entering the elevator to
go down to buy cough medicine and said that uhhhh i am not in my </span><span
lang=ZH-CN>最も大丈夫</span><span lang=EN-GB>mottomo daijōbu state) that’ll be good,
if he got the raise. Also, he decided to change the topic for the 2nd time,
probably because I mentioned that the intern last year also did some topic
related to carbon dioxide emissions.</span></b></p>

Shaina texted for help. I hesitated knowing that Friday night is a precious

I rushed home to change into shorts &amp; T-shirt and then headed out.
Eventually we realised that the help I could offer was only marginal and so I
headed directly home. Having tapped into the station and wanting to avoid being
charged on my card, I told the train staff that I was using the toilet in the
station (false) and did not take the train (true) and got to tap out and walked

of Australian mandarins (for the first time, usually I get the local ones that

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I found that the reason why the pork

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Today was kind of like a lazy morning
and I forgot to leave my wet socks outside to dry overnight so about 11:00 a.m.
I finally put all my clothes that I have washed yesterday that I had no space
to put outside because the space outside was occupied by the bed sheets and I
put the stuff along the railings right outside my door. I actually contemplated
going somewhere further for breakfast but it was so insanely hot today it
reached 25 I mean 35° Celsius so that was really terrible and I decided to go
to the nearest family Mart to get something warm because I did not have any
warm water left and I do not want to go back home to microwave the stuff though
arguably I could have microwaved a bento box right at the convenience store. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Finally
to top off the fried chicken leg and the beef Crockett that I have bought for
378 yen (¥100 for </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>ファミコロ　</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>and ¥278 for the Premium
chicken </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>プレミアムチキン　</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>which was a very yummy  leg
indeed) I went to the specific Cafe that I have always visited and is called
three con Cafe and the lady seemed a little wary of me I was just wearing a
singlets with a lanyard around my neck and I was wearing shorts, the lady did
not want to get within like 2 meter of me even though I was ordering the stuff
and she only collected the coins that I had put on the tray when I went off to
the other side so I felt like she was extremely repulsed by me. So I have two
possible reasons: one of the reasons is that I was wearing a singlet and the
other reason is because the day before when I went there for breakfast or two
days before actually I dropped the sandwich on the floor and she held a grudge
for that. Anyway I ate the chicken leg way before I got the order for creamy
sandwich and so I topped off the hot milk tea with the beef croquet.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Anyway it does not matter and eventually
my strawberry sandwich which cost me $167 yen as well as the hot drink which
cost me about 200 yen totaled up to a bill of $396 yen. So because I did not
want to breathe in that cigarette smoky smell within the cafe sat outside the
cafe well facing the opposite side of the road and drank my hot milk tea.
Needless to say this made me sweat a lot and also because I did not bring my
Wi-Fi out due to my tpg SIM card being activated and having mobile data I was
rushing to get home so that it wouldn't take me more than half an hour to reply
to my darling. So after having that meal at about 11:10 a.m. I went back home
to enjoy the air conditioning and after that I just sat down on the floor of
course I hung out my stuff and then I was going to get ready to meet my uncle
at 12:00 noon.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>When I texted my uncle at 11:33 a.m. to
my gross surprise he and his wife and kids had actually reached the place
already and so it turns out they were doing some shopping beforehand so that
they will be ready at the area when I came and that was a little surprising for
me so I did not want to be too late and I rushed off the house at about 11:40
and then I reached the station at 11:47 just narrowly missing the 1146 a.m.
train to Shibuya and when I reach Shibuya it was exactly 12 noon and my uncle
had changed the meeting spot to be directly at the Singaporean restaurant that
I had chosen. So I took that hot hot root filled with people who's only
exclamation and the only way coming out of the mouth is the Japanese word for
hot which is ATSUI. Then I walked across the famous CBS circular bridge to see
all the people at the artificial turf and like sitting in the cool tents to get
away from the heat and I eventually reached the beef cuts to place which is
just one floor below the Singaporean place I thought they were previously in
different buildings but anyway even on a hot 37° kind of weltering day that was
still a line that seemed to last for about 1 hour that was extending out of the
beef katsu shop. And I saw this water sprayer and then some Japanese ladies
standing there getting a bit of mist I really like strong water jets but more
like little Miss to reduce the heat it was so bad. I hovered outside the
restaurant until like 12:10 p.m. when I found out that a bunch of tourists were
blocking the way to the elevator which is beside the beef katsu place so I took
the elevator. The minutes the elevator door opened on the second floor my
uncle's wife was the first to pop interview followed by my uncle and then his
two kids so this was one of the most narrow walkway it is more narrow than all
the suite corridors at Harvard and we were not the only ones who are lining up
for a seat and it turns out that all the tables are really tiny in fact those
tables would probably fit like two people in an American setting but in the
Japanese setting they're going to have four people sit at one table. So we
waited there for a good 20 minutes before one of the so-called 4 person table
was able to accommodate us and we brought all our bags except for the baby
carriage. We left it in the corridor which is directly perpendicular to the
toilet. Everything was so jammed packed together that anyone who wants to exit
the restaurant has to shimmy past us and one of the restaurants staff, who was
a heavy set women with what looked like blonde hair curlers in her hair,
actually advised the next pairs of people that were lining out for a seat in
the restaurant to open the back door and wait for the seats along the stairway
which obviously had no air conditioning so she apologized a little bit for
shooting them out to a place that was obviously at a higher temperature.
Eventually we got to the table and by then I already decided it what sort of
stuff I was going to order I was going to get a bit of each kind of seafood I
was going to get the HOKKIEN MEE which is a specific Singapore dish that's not
even found in my home province so a bit of a misnomer. I also thought I would
get one of a chronic and then a bit of a soft shell crab and one of it I was
going to make it spicy and the other one I will keep it non-spicy but it turns
out all the dishes are like adjusted to the Japanese taste palate so it was not
spicy at all in the end. Corresponding to the glowing Google review by a
Singaporean patron of this restaurant, I was going to get the large chicken
rice to assess the authenticity of it compared to a Singaporean hawker centre
chicken rice. My uncle's daughter (7 year old Fumino who is very shy and
reticent and from whom I have barely heard a word) wanted chicken soup so we
probably spent like 170 yen on just a bowl of chicken soup which is a little
bit steep compared to what I can get in Singapore. Anyway the cold chicken
dishes took very short time to arrive but anything that was stir Fry such as
the noodles the prawn and the crab two guys at least half an hour and that was
a super long wait but I understand because there was only one chef in charge of
the stir fry. There were points during this meal where I was thinking well we
have run out of conversation topics this is it but I always had something to
ask them and I also updated them about my favorite person in the world coming
to visit me in Tokyo Japan and son of the attractions that we are visiting and
if they had any prior experiences such as the ropeway called catchy catchy
which is along the way between Mount Fuji 5th station and the Kawaguchi Lake.
Also this time I had a little bit more interactions with the 8-month-old baby
who is really cute and who is really adored by his elder sister and I sniffed
his hair and I poked his cheek. That I was absolutely stuffed and I thought
I'll be good until like 8:00 p.m. on 9:00 p.m. for dinner.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>After that my uncle for some reason
wanted to walk to a flower shop and then I asked him twice is he going to get a
flowers for a specific occasion and then they were like oh we were just taking
a look we should even treat it and they did not buy any flowers. So in this one
kilometer track down from Shibuya all the way till Aoyama University and until
this aayoyama flower shop we were just covering ourselves up with umbrellas and
ntuv Ray shirts and the elder sister was so hot she hit in the baby carriage
along the baby and the baby fell asleep in her arms which is really cute.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>My own babies wish for acute Disney
haircut was constantly on my mind so after touring the flower shop I said bye
to them and I told them that I will meet them again in August and then I walked
probably at least for 20 minutes till the Disney store in Shibuya. On the way I
saw a farmers market which sold not just fruits and vegetables but also sold
dogs for adoption or something and then I stroke this huge lion dog which looks
like a tibet Shepherd or something. I was so thirsty that I spent $450 yen on
what was probably 100 ml of Peace chews which is really a huge scam because I
asked him to remove the ice and what I was left with was just a pathetic amount
that I drank in like 2 seconds. Normally if I'm feeling aggressive I would tell
them hey that is too pathetic I'm paying $450 yen for this pathetic little bit
of drink you're not even filling up 1/3 of the cup let it on like half of it.
But I didn't say it.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Omg I am absolutely MIND BLOWN &#129327;Yoshikei 
has these recipes for housewives.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>And they have everything you need AND
basically deliver each days menu and require ingredients and everything looks
colourful and delicious. Basically you don’t have to think about nutrition or
chop up stuff and you just follow this mindlessly, so funny!! Epic Japan
moment. Also say for example the ingredient involves diced carrots, then the
company will deliver the packs of the ready made ingredients, freshly sliced or
chopped or grated or whatever format is required, such that with a quick rinse
you could start cooking them for your family!</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>wow time to be a housewife in Japan
(just kidding). I do feel the domestic chores being lightened by the sheer
range of services that companies can dream up of, to make family chores
hassle-free and to just reduce the need to think or decide, when it comes to
maintaining a good nutritional level for the family and all that jazz. Which I
think Western side does not really care about. They do not feel the need to
have a multicoloured platters of delights nor have variety across the week,
which is something mind-boggling for me, having emerged from my Asian cultural
bog of food diversity and ensuring there is always a freshness and a
mix-and-match.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Masato or Mayo is just lying on the sofa
and studying his chemistry. He also likes to play classical music like a true
intellectual - recently it has been Air on G string by Johann Sebastian Bach,
which in Japanese is pronounced BA-HA with the slight stop between the 2
syllables (which is a phenomenon known as gemination in phonetics, present in
Japanese, Korean and Cantonese.)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>We started making dumplings at about 1pm

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I also started drafting the report and

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Afternoon was mostly quiet and sitting
at the dining table. I remarked that I was surprised that Matsumoto (as a
fellow Dragon year) was more attentive to household chores than most Japanese
men and always did the dishes. He looks permanently angry with arched eyebrows
but he’s a super caring man I could tell to his wife. The type that never
complains and never has a temper I think. Very wholesome couple!</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Upon

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>One small phenomenon that I
realise is that rather than using the more angular and visually distinguishable

be harder and less cute. It does seem to be the case as Hiragana is more like
bubble letters with curves while Katakana has sharp bends, using Hiragana can
make the shop name appear cuter and therefore endow an affectionate nature to
the brand.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>Went
to office at about 9:10am to collect my charger for Dell laptop and worked a
little bit. Was fortunate today not to miss any trains. Operation: Sneak out of

against someone’s hair attracted their ire but I was impervious.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I typed that on the train at about
8:50am. After that I experienced a tiny stomachache in the morning but I just
casually dismissed it and it soon disappeared. I simply focused on my work.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>I
was pretty hungry by noon but Feng Shan Shan said she had a meeting so I had to
wait for her oh well.. I considered trying the Beijing Snack that was offered
on the table, purportedly by a Chinese client because I did not recognise the
name of the donor as any employee in P&amp;E, but decided to just be a loser
and drink water. Also I decided to get something soupy for lunch if it was
available (alas, it was not; the beef sukiyaki </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>焼き鍋</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> was unfortunately sold out).</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I think for the lunch set below (which
only cost me ¥1089 muahuahua although I semi-expected Feng to step forward and
foot the bill for me but she let me go forward and pay, we separated the bill
as per all tenets of Fairness and Equity and all that), the big rice wasn’t as
monstrous as last time which is great because I don’t want a scenario of
bloated tummy. The cabbage salad was laced with a refreshing citrus dressing
(possibly lemon) and the grated radish in the beef soaked up a lot of the
butter flavor such that it was very umami and I also soaked some of the cabbage
slices into that beef sauce. Which is mostly butter but whatever.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Anyway, I actually had a super
productive morning where I made use of thinkcell in powerpoint to make a few
different kinds of charts, updated my excel sheet and found some super useful
summaries of 2023 and 2022 foodtech scenes in the global market and in japan.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I also had a pretty enriching lunch
conversation with Feng Shan Shan, who had been dating her Japanese boyfriend
trailing back from college years for the past 7 years and is currently renting
an apartment with him. Feng studied sociolinguistics in Osaka university after
completing her bachelors degree in China and we always talk about the adventure
of seeing the wider world, she expressed her urayamashi feeling at my current
life. Also I wanted to delve more into sociolinguistics, linguistic psychology
and all that cognitive stuff as well as language acquisition and I wished that
she could share some of these documents so I can see what i am interested in
and perhaps pursue that in college.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Just at the “cafe” section of the office
and enjoying the slurping sounds made by Mr Morimoto and the fragrance of the
tomato meat thingy that he is eating (I did not turn my head at all to see what
exactly he is eating but it smells like spaghetti), and tapping of everyone’s
fingertips on their keyboard. Today there is an incredible number of people in
office despite the continued heat outside.</span></b><img width=141 height=1
src="./image405.png" align=left hspace=12 vspace=12></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Also, some guy with a Chinese name
starting with Liu had left a lot of snacks on the countertop of the office cafe
and I was tempted to try a fruit pudding which looked pretty yummy. There was a
grape flavoured one with actual big peeled grapes embedded within the jelly,
but for some reason I was concerned about the sugar content and the fact that
these fruits are not fresh, and I ended up not taking any of these products.
Also, there was a bunch of fruit candies that are basically like preserved
apples and plums and all that, and because of my strong affinity for green
beans, I had a beijing snack that was yellow bean paste.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Had dinner with Michael Tan and we also
went to Mcdonalds (decided not to queue because there were too many people) and
then to Sukiya.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>After that we toured Claris bookstore. I
might have made a joke about his parents migrating from China to the US that crossed
the line a little bit and the man was like Excuse you &#128578; I awkwardly
laughed it over and indicated it was just a joke. It was so hot and I
unbuttoned the top 3 buttons of my light blue shirt. The new black leather
shoes I bought were slightly chafing my heels but no matter, I survived the
walk. After the bookstore visit, we hovered around and eventually got to Ozeki
market where I bought a bunch of food. Here is the receipt for this </span><span
lang=ZH-CN>￥</span><span lang=EN-GB>619 purchase, consisting of three counts of
20% discounted products due to them expiring on the same night, including a
pack of 6 xiaolongbao, a kombu onigiri and some red bean onigiri thing that
looks like yam paste mashed into a ball I have no clue.</span></b></p>

that we entered mcdonalds and saw that the queue was too long (I was a little

(but still took some chopsticks and a cup of hot water and a cup of hot tea
from the dispenser), but Michael Tan wanted dessert so he got this cheap
chocolate pudding thing, he was asking if he should get caramel pudding or
chocolate and he settled on the latter even though I recommended the former,
This came in a Häagen-Dazs sized container and it was obviously factory made,
and he scooped out bits of pudding and showed me the consistency of it, in how
uniform and how solidly packed each particle of the pudding was and I thought
wow maybe I will try the caramel pudding next time.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Got back home at about 9pm but had to
wait for Yang Yi to come home which turned to 9:40pm and eventually to 10:21pm.
Took some random street photos using a timer. Also because I was hanging my
heavy bag with 2 containers and my 3 grocery items onto one of those
pawn-shaped weighted holders that is meant as a cordon, I accidentally tipped
that cordon over and some water leaked out, thankfully not onto my computer but
only onto part of my bag strap. Got back showered and analysed with Yang Yi
what he did wrong apart from being not punctual (he even went to the
convenience store to buy a bento and wait for it to heat up while I was still
hanging around outside the house because I did not have the key and was
gracious enough to give it to him at the start of the day). I remember his 2
deadly sins include Lust and Greed so I am like this is a major red flag in any
sort of relationships by the way.</span></b></p>

ended up being wasted, very sad. Buying and wasting food is really that new low
in life that I created since the start of college, though most of the wasted

Directions have open my mind up to the boundless possibilities and positive
impact that a team of elite Japan consultants can deliver to the business world
in every industry, ranging from small fledgling firms to well-established
international corporations. I have witnessed consultants putting in all of
their skills to work – in their mind-boggling ability to absorb and soak in a
whole industry knowledge, their speed and skills with the Microsoft office
suite and an eye for aesthetics and detail, and even in coding and programming
to serve the logistics needs of clients better – to excel at their job and go
beyond that to completely eradicate any of the clients’ concerns.</span></b></p>

meticulous planning of the team, I was able to witness the sheer scale and
brilliant minds that go behind an international corporation based in Japan, by
listening from and speaking to the top minds at NOK’s Shōnan R&amp;D Center,
witnessing the many processes at play that involved lasers, X-rays, huge
machines and more than 8000 different materials and ingredients for
investigating the ideal combination of materials to achieve the desired
properties (heat resistance, electrical resistance, moldability, re-bonding…),
and even trying my hand on a hairband, a brain-wave detecting cap, and a few
rubber strips that have been engineered to be able to fuse back together!</span></b></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0in'><b><span lang=EN-GB>I was inspired by the sheer energy
and passion that the engineers brought to their work. For instance, one of the
engineer who covered the experimental department of NOK (seated behind Mr
Shimada and to the left of Ms Wada) shared about his childhood fascination with
cars and how he applied the science of rubber making to the tires of a remote-controlled
racecar to make the car bounce less. I think this spirit of scientific inquiry
is definitely to an inborn curiosity and desire to understand nature, and using
the laws of physics and material science to serve the good of mankind.</span></b></p>

 I learnt that one of the most important skills a consultant can have is to ask
the right questions and in the right matter and tone, which is a skill that can
help one amass the correct information and even establish good relations,
showing that you are able to arrive at the core of an issue and understand
implicit assumptions. For instance, in response to Mr Katsuzaki’s question of
“Can we scale up this technology of the shock-absorbent tire to a commercial
vehicle?”, the NOK engineer answered how commercial cars are different from toy
cars and the types of considerations that designers and manufacturers would
have to incorporate into designing actual tires. Also, I learnt that
experimenting in R&amp;D might begin with a seemingly innocuous premise, but
the outcomes that we derive from it can have unforeseen implications on the
industry.</span></b></p>

knowing what people need and thinking about current gaps that we have not
filled. It reminded me of all the innovative solutions to common problems
afflicting, and my middle school and elementary school innovative design/design
thinking classes: find a societal problem and work on it. In this case, we are
referring to detecting dementia, in the harrowing backdrop of ageing population
and lowering fertility rate in Japan and many other developed countries.
Visiting the facilities for testing these waves also enlightened me to the
countless hours of hardware and software testing that must go behind this cap
that eventually a patient can wear, and that what we are witnessing can never
fully represent the entire arduous process of ideation and product creations
that are riddled with failure. This is exactly why NOK has the largest
proportion of young people from 20 to 30 years old (just like me), and a
reminder for me to persevere despite facing setbacks in all aspects of life.</span></b></p>

e-mobility department of NOK mentioned how 80% of their time is dedicated to
company work and 20% is dedicated to creativity and innovation, such as coming
up with more robust and efficient frameworks and even questioning existing
processes: is there a way we can do things differently? Why are there air gaps
between the vehicular batteries in the first place? What is the rationale for a
process and how can we rectify it to fit the demands of the world and our
workers? This flexibility in mindset is definite something important for large
companies where many mindsets and practices can be entrenched – I was

science and technology being our tool but not dominating our worldview: I
learnt of the importance of balance between science and business: learning
about management, latest industry insights and many other fields like
humanities and art enables a team to develop holistically, and also branch out
relations as NOK cannot exists alone without the support of its domestic and
overseas partner. During the conversations that Mr Shimada had with Mr Katō, I
was drawn to how both sides represented a large elite team and were able to
process information very swiftly and cover a wide range of topics, such as the
burgeoning electric vehicle industry in China and how to transform business
models to fit market needs. I was captivated by their exchange and also

soil of creativity of this R&amp;D team, and being offered this rare privilege
to even touch and try out these products and walk through the experimental
setups is something very special for me. In addition, the rare honor of
attempting to speak Japanese in front of both P&amp;E and the NOK staff made me
very nervous but also thankful that I was given this platform to speak and
reflect by Mr Shimada, and these learnings will be something I will carry forth
to my work life in the future. I am very grateful to Mr Shimada for offering me
this experience and privilege, and the special attention he had always given to
bring me the most multi-faceted view of P&amp;E directions as well as business
insights in Japan.</span></b></p>

first struck me about this place was the incense they put at the door, and the
majestic golden light-like fixture in the middle of the temple. Then it was the
monk that conducted the whole ceremony who spoke with poise and precision. I
was brought back to memories of a childhood anime </span></b><b><span
lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>一休</span></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> which to the monk carried
many lessons of life wisdom. We also had many thoughtful question and answer
sessions where we talked about Western mindfulness versus Buddhist style
meditation, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan and how Buddhism derives and
modifies aspects of Hinduism, as well as </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>お釈迦様</span></b><b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> and the caste system in India. The
highlight of the session was definitely the part where we indicate that we are
losing focus during the meditation, and invite our shoulders to be whacked by
the monk using a long wooden stick. It did not hurt and was a good reminder to
concentrate, or let our minds not dwell excessively on the peripheral, but
focus on our immediate surroundings. It was very difficult to do but by the
third meditation, I learnt to grasp the core ideas and apply what the monk
taught us. We also enjoyed matcha. The performance given by the monk was highly
impressive (where he chanted Buddhist verses in a 8-beat rhythm) and helped to
calm my mind. I was very thankful for this experience to listen from the monk
and also have Mr He, Ms Feng to help me translate certain difficult parts I did
not know.</span></b></p>

the tea ceremony, I understood the concepts of </span></b><b><span lang=ZH-CN
style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>和敬清寂 </span><i><span lang=EN-GB>wakeiseijaku</span></i></b><b><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'> and </span></b><b><span

lang=EN-GB>ichigo ichie </span></i><span lang=EN-GB>which have been adopted by
samurais too to foster a sense of peace and appreciation for nature.
Personally, I have had experiences reading books about <i>ichigo ichie</i> and
internalizing the concept that no point in history is ever replicable and the
importance of treasuring such moments with the people in the present around us.
This is something particularly sentimental and remarkable for me, as my time
with P&amp;E direction slowly draws to a close and there is no 100% guarantee
of a next meet. I also thought about how having a protected space that is
purely reserved for tea, appreciating the season’s offerings, and having
conversations not related to the battlefield (for the samurais who used this
concept) was such an important reminder of balance in life, that we should take
the time to slow down and see the little things, and also forget about status
and rank as these are passing clouds in life. Indeed, having the <i>nijiriguchi</i>
serve as an entrance to the tea ceremony area allowed everyone to bow down and
crawl through and regard all contemporaries as equals, regardless of whatever
great things they did outside of the tea room. In addition, the relevance of
the tea ceremony to other key tenets of Japanese culture such as architecture,
poetry, painting, calligraphy, pottery and others, made me realize the heritage
and richness of Japanese culture. I was also extremely impressed by the poise
and elegance with which the <i>chazen</i> tea ceremony staff conducted herself.
None of her actions were done with hesitation or with any excessive movement:
everything was clean and clear like a mountain stream. I grew a newfound
appreciation for Japanese culture and arts and the importance of gratitude.</span></b></p>

had a rare privilege to bond with Mr M, Mr He and Ms Feng, as I asked Mr
M about his experience growing up in Japan, his accommodations and the
sorts of food he would eat. He shared extensively given his knowledge of fish
and river food, and told us all about the different types of fish available and
the specific one that we ordered, called <i>kinki</i> which is a red deep sea
perch. We also talked about what activities the previous intern did and what
sort of cultural activities future interns from Harvard could look forward to.
Immersing in this environment where most things are made from traditional
craftsmanship and we could put our feet into the space below the table, I felt
like I had travelled back in time and it was very awe-inspiring. I am deeply
thankful for Mr M’s meticulous planning: he even researched and knew
that this restaurant has a squatting-style toilet and asked if we wanted to use
the normal toilet that was at the tea ceremony place.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>It’s already 3 minutes past departure
time.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>It is starting!!! I hear the engines.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>A miracle happened. So we were standing
at the top of the boat while the wind was blowing very hard. Before I could say
“holy macaroni”, my glasses got blown off my face.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>The four of us hear a small clang before
the spectacles disappeared. I think the movement of my hand was impeded by the
fact that I was holding my selfie stick and my whole tote bag of random items
(the Japan Reischauer institute bag that I had never really cleared). Wei Ye,
followed by Xing Hong, decided that we should look down within the boat because
they supposed that the clanging was the glasses hitting the staircase and going
down into the boat cabin.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>In reality, there was the possibility
that the glasses hit the metal railing, slid down the smooth round surface of
the boat and completely disappeared into the sea.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I was kind of optimistic that my glasses
went inside the cabin, but my hope and optimism decayed over time. I was ready
to give up and nurse my heart ache &#129301; of my couple glasses disappearing
and the nagging doubt that this was something foreboding.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>But Xing Hong encouraged me to keep
searching. Since he had also learnt Japanese and spoke pretty well, he
encouraged me to ask others for help; he said that if I had asked the whole
boat, I definitely would have gotten everyone’s help. On a final desperate
ditch of effort, I asked the kind looking tanned old man welcoming us off the
ship to help me. He was very grandpa looking and he asked first the male staff
at the top of the boat to do a purge of the deck. Whereupon he reported
nothing. Just when I thought all hope was lost, he unlocked the railing and
helped me search far and wide on the smooth board of the boat.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I followed uncle Junxin back to the
condominium and on the way we were quiet for a lot of the time because I had
already asked him about life in Guangzhou (he was back there with his wife and
2 kids for 10 days), Kyoto and Ōsaka.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Also, on the way I realised he has lived
a life of thrift and parsimony given how he has tried all the cheap options of
travelling from Kyoto to Tokyo such as the bus I had considered. He described
his personal experience as Terrible because he could not sleep on the bus and
it was bumpy. He also described to me another ticket and travel option known as
</span><span lang=ZH-CN>青春</span><span lang=EN-GB>18 which is a cheap
multi-ticket package (you get 5 different train tickets for transferring
between all different lines and you could sell off these tickets if you had
some remaining) that you could buy for not an expensive price, to get from
Kansai (the region of Kyōto and Ōsaka) to Tokyo. It could take an entire day,
as </span><span lang=ZH-CN>俊鑫</span><span lang=EN-GB> described his younger
brother </span><span lang=ZH-CN>俊宏</span><span lang=EN-GB> had made that full
day trip.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>I also asked him what’s his work like
now, and he said he has 3 projects concurrently and is constantly on the search
for more clients. This is very much like a consultants work. During dinner he
also mentioned, upon my incessant asking, that he had worked in firms that
consisted of all Japanese employees, mainly men. And I thought wow he could
keep all his differences in and purely focus on work, which he actually did
from 7am all the way until dinner time where he met me.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>We did not text at all before that,
