<h1>Dear Juniors,</h1>
<p1>I’m Simon, RI ’19 and currently serving my NS in the police force. I took H2 Physics, Chemistry, Math and German, H1 General Paper, and H3 Math for A Levels. Having done well eventually, I decided to collate the tools and tips for each subject that helped me tide through A Levels especially in the months leading up to it. If there’s anything below that you’re not sure about, or resources that you want like PDF notes or AnkiDecks, feel free to drop me an email at simon_smile2011@yahoo.com.sg.
  As an INFP who is primarily affected and driven by emotions, I understand the feelings that many of you might be afflicted with now during the circuit breaker: confusion, crippling anxiety, and perhaps guilt accompanying the inability to focus on the unconventional lesson style of online delivery. It is okay to feel those, and I have felt those before in the revision period pre-A Levels. （〠_〠） It is fine to not do well because given consistent effort and being AWARE of yourself and the syllabus content, you’ll be on an upward trend: have faith! And recite this mantra:</p1>

<h2>How I dealt with it in 2019:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Video called my dad to share my stresses and worries</li>
  <li>Take strolls downstairs with my mum</li>
  <li>Run to the park connectors to release them endorphins</li>
  <li>Find people I like to study with who’ll motivate (/peer pressure) me to focus (or play pool to unwind a little)</li>
  <li>Phone/vid call people - especially pertinent in this period</li>
  <li>Write encouraging cards for people and hopefully receive them too #BOOMER</li>
  <li>Also, complete My RI Journey [it's a template to fill in reflections and activities which helped with my understanding of self and to consolidate the things I did outside of academics] to give myself a breather</li>
</ol> 

<h3>Only apply for overseas university if you can handle the additional stress</h3> 
<p>(if you’re masochistic maybe you’ll find it fun!) and if you want something slightly different to try. For me, it was about minimising regret since I have J2 and 2 years of NS to try, but there’s an opportunity cost to trying for stuff. Know your limits.</p>
<h3>Use the scraps of time you have – fragmentary time when commuting, or when you feel like stoning. </h3>
<p>You can always listen to something relevant, especially for GP and the H2 Third Languages which test your knowledge of current affairs (H2 Third Languages less so since a lot of it is still about language ability).</p>

<p>Most of the de-stressing activities can still be done in spite of the COVID-19 situation and know that you’re not alone! Everyone is feeling trashy that some part of their experience has been snatched away from them; support and understanding to those around you is often better than grievance and bitterness. And that in the grand scale of things, A Levels will be a memorable chapter but ultimately does not define you. After the circuit breaker is over, hopefully you’ll also get the chance to mug and bond with friends. Social interaction helps.</p>

<p>School timed practices are really there for you to find out all your blind spots and things you don’t know or know but unable to apply in the exam condition. Take every exam seriously: don’t let that letter grade be the closure of the chapter. Go through all the mistakes you made in the paper: are those careless mistakes made under pressure, or content that you didn’t manage to cover? The most important ones are the things you don’t know that you don’t know, e.g. that little reaction tucked away in the corner of the lecture notes that you missed out. Not just school papers, other schools’ prelims would be really helpful too in pinpointing these areas.</p>

<h1>Useful apps</h1>
<p>I didn’t trust myself to use my phone much – it was distracting and sometimes I’ll just leave my phone at home and leave the house to study at a nearby Community Centre. But at the times when I felt disciplined enough to use my phone, I had safety measures i.e. phone locking apps that improved my productivity. That being said, phone usage isn’t unproductive all the time - discussing questions with peers via text helped to consolidate my understanding, and asking teachers/peers for help is also very convenient! Don’t be afraid to ask for help, whether academic wise or with respect to stress management. You might be surprised how many people are willing to help. </p>

<ul>
  <li><h3>Flipd</h3>
  <p>I actually got to know this app through a junior who volunteered at Operation Einstein yay thank you if you’re reading this. Anyway, if I’m going to do a paper or something that requires a few hours of focus, I’ll use this to lock my phone so I only have access to phone call, music, maps etc. It was super useful because I had compulsive urges to check social media and this helped to limit my phone functions to the few (relatively) essential ones. I used this more often than Forest which doesn’t forcibly lock your phone.</p>

  <li><h3>Anki Droid!!!ヾ(✿◕ ω◕ฺ）人(◕ω ◕✿）ノ </h3>
  <p>AnkiDroid is a flashcards deck app (there’s also Quizlet which some classmates used but I haven’t tried it) with inbuilt picture/audio options which uses <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/level-up-your-learning-with-anki-and-spaced-repetition-3c1a84003ced">spaced repetition</a>to help one memorise things – it reinforces the cards that you’re not so familiar with and its algorithms automate the learning process. I started using it in November 2018 to cram Japanese vocabulary and it’s really useful if you want to memorise ANYTHING – provided you put in the effort to open the app. For A levels, I used it to help me with Chemistry and Physics definitions. The former I found online (there are so many AnkiDecks free online by big-hearted people out there) and the second one I just typed in the list of definitions I had into the app manually. Just search for “Anki _____ Deck” online and tadah!</p>

  <p>o These are screenshots of my Anki Decks; those German words mean “Again”, “Difficult”, “Good” and “Easy” and you just click on them depending on how familiar you are. I found reading out the definitions to be helpful for my memorisation, but you should see which style of learning is the most suitable for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Surprisingly, <h3>WhatsApp!</h3>
  <p><a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/feynman-technique/">Teaching something to others reinforces your understanding</a> 
  and it’s quite wholesome if you have a group or some people who would regularly send questions to discuss and help each other in your understanding throughout A Levels which I was fortunate to have!  I didn’t hesitate to ask those really smart but forthcoming friends for academic help and also ask seniors for advice, and you shouldn’t either. Of course, this is on the basis of you having done your revision and having squeezed out as much juice from the school-provided materials as you could.</p>

  <li>New York Times App: the language in both the articles and comment sections were rich sources of vocabulary and argumentation. The podcasts can be listened to on the go!</li>
  <li>Straits Times. Duh. And an array of other news apps to compliment your media diet.</li>
