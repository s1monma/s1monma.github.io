<h1>Dear Juniors,</h1>
<p1>I’m Simon, RI ’19 and currently serving my NS in the police force. I took H2 Physics, Chemistry, Math and German, H1 General Paper, and H3 Math for A Levels. Having done well eventually, I decided to collate the tools and tips for each subject that helped me tide through A Levels especially in the months leading up to it. If there’s anything below that you’re not sure about, or resources that you want like PDF notes or AnkiDecks, feel free to drop me an email at simon_smile2011@yahoo.com.sg.
  As an INFP who is primarily affected and driven by emotions, I understand the feelings that many of you might be afflicted with now during the circuit breaker: confusion, crippling anxiety, and perhaps guilt accompanying the inability to focus on the unconventional lesson style of online delivery. It is okay to feel those, and I have felt those before in the revision period pre-A Levels. （〠_〠） It is fine to not do well because given consistent effort and being AWARE of yourself and the syllabus content, you’ll be on an upward trend: have faith! And recite this mantra:</p1>

<h2>How I dealt with it in 2019:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Video called my dad to share my stresses and worries</li>
  <li>Take strolls downstairs with my mum</li>
  <li>Run to the park connectors to release them endorphins</li>
  <li>Find people I like to study with who’ll motivate (/peer pressure) me to focus (or play pool to unwind a little)</li>
  <li>Phone/vid call people - especially pertinent in this period</li>
  <li>Write encouraging cards for people and hopefully receive them too #BOOMER</li>
  <li>Also, complete My RI Journey [it's a template to fill in reflections and activities which helped with my understanding of self and to consolidate the things I did outside of academics] to give myself a breather</li>
</ol> 

<h3>Only apply for overseas university if you can handle the additional stress</h3> 
<p>(if you’re masochistic maybe you’ll find it fun!) and if you want something slightly different to try. For me, it was about minimising regret since I have J2 and 2 years of NS to try, but there’s an opportunity cost to trying for stuff. Know your limits.</p>
<h3>Use the scraps of time you have – fragmentary time when commuting, or when you feel like stoning. </h3>
<p>You can always listen to something relevant, especially for GP and the H2 Third Languages which test your knowledge of current affairs (H2 Third Languages less so since a lot of it is still about language ability).</p>

<p>Most of the de-stressing activities can still be done in spite of the COVID-19 situation and know that you’re not alone! Everyone is feeling trashy that some part of their experience has been snatched away from them; support and understanding to those around you is often better than grievance and bitterness. And that in the grand scale of things, A Levels will be a memorable chapter but ultimately does not define you. After the circuit breaker is over, hopefully you’ll also get the chance to mug and bond with friends. Social interaction helps.</p>

</div>

<p>School timed practices are really there for you to find out all your blind spots and things you don’t know or know but unable to apply in the exam condition. Take every exam seriously: don’t let that letter grade be the closure of the chapter. Go through all the mistakes you made in the paper: are those careless mistakes made under pressure, or content that you didn’t manage to cover? The most important ones are the things you don’t know that you don’t know, e.g. that little reaction tucked away in the corner of the lecture notes that you missed out. Not just school papers, other schools’ prelims would be really helpful too in pinpointing these areas.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Useful apps</h1>
<p>I didn’t trust myself to use my phone much – it was distracting and sometimes I’ll just leave my phone at home and leave the house to study at a nearby Community Centre. But at the times when I felt disciplined enough to use my phone, I had safety measures i.e. phone locking apps that improved my productivity. That being said, phone usage isn’t unproductive all the time - discussing questions with peers via text helped to consolidate my understanding, and asking teachers/peers for help is also very convenient! Don’t be afraid to ask for help, whether academic wise or with respect to stress management. You might be surprised how many people are willing to help. </p>

<ul>
  <li><h3>Flipd</h3>
  <p>I actually got to know this app through a junior who volunteered at Operation Einstein yay thank you if you’re reading this. Anyway, if I’m going to do a paper or something that requires a few hours of focus, I’ll use this to lock my phone so I only have access to phone call, music, maps etc. It was super useful because I had compulsive urges to check social media and this helped to limit my phone functions to the few (relatively) essential ones. I used this more often than Forest which doesn’t forcibly lock your phone.</p>

  <li><h3>Anki Droid!!!ヾ(✿◕ ω◕ฺ）人(◕ω ◕✿）ノ </h3>
  <p>AnkiDroid is a flashcards deck app (there’s also Quizlet which some classmates used but I haven’t tried it) with inbuilt picture/audio options 
    which uses <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/level-up-your-learning-with-anki-and-spaced-repetition-3c1a84003ced">spaced repetition</a> to help one memorise things – it reinforces the cards that you’re not so familiar with and its algorithms automate the learning process. I started using it in November 2018 to cram Japanese vocabulary and it’s really useful if you want to memorise ANYTHING – provided you put in the effort to open the app. For A levels, I used it to help me with Chemistry and Physics definitions. The former I found online (there are so many AnkiDecks free online by big-hearted people out there) and the second one I just typed in the list of definitions I had into the app manually. Just search for “Anki _____ Deck” online and tadah!</p>

  </div>
  <p>o These are screenshots of my Anki Decks; those German words mean “Again”, “Difficult”, “Good” and “Easy” and you just click on them depending on how familiar you are. I found reading out the definitions to be helpful for my memorisation, but you should see which style of learning is the most suitable for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Surprisingly, <h3>WhatsApp!</h3>
  <p><a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/feynman-technique/">Teaching something to others reinforces your understanding</a> 
  and it’s quite wholesome if you have a group or some people who would regularly send questions to discuss and help each other in your understanding throughout A Levels which I was fortunate to have!  I didn’t hesitate to ask those really smart but forthcoming friends for academic help and also ask seniors for advice, and you shouldn’t either. Of course, this is on the basis of you having done your revision and having squeezed out as much juice from the school-provided materials as you could.</p>
  </li>
  <li>New York Times App: the language in both the articles and comment sections were rich sources of vocabulary and argumentation. The podcasts can be listened to on the go!</li>
  <li>Straits Times. Duh. And an array of other news apps to compliment your media diet.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h1>H1 General Paper!</h1>
<p>You don’t have to read the info pack that the school provides. The great thing about GP is that it’s so open-ended that you can just read all sorts of random material related to current affairs and learn it in many other ways! </p>
<p>It’s really tiring to use your eyes all the time and I’ll switch to using my ears – the podcasts within New York Times app (recommended to me by a good friend) are good to listen to on the go, and of course radio channels like BBC World Service 88.9FM were useful for me when I couldn’t sleep at night. Spotify also has many podcasts, like by The Economist.</p>
<p>Fun fact: a few days before the GP Prelims I couldn’t sleep and was listening to the radio and heard about Jack Ma and Elon Musk’s debate at a conference with regards to Artificial Intelligence (AI) – I also read about it on WeChat. Serendipitously, AI came out as a topic for both the prelims and actual A Levels and having used that exchange as an essay opener and done well, I used it again for the actual As and about 10 people did the same… LOL</p>
<p>Submit your essays and AQs for marking, and time yourself when writing because time management is often an issue when you get too carried away just spamming your evidence without distilling out the key argument points and links back to the question.</p>
<p>Then note down the learning points and keep practising generating ideas!
  And you might realise then that some characteristics is transferable to different
  domains, e.g. the characteristics you pick out of your society for AQ.</p>
<div class="imgcontainer">

  alt="AQ" width="400" height="600">
</div>

<hr>
<h1>H2 Chemistry!</h1>
<p>First off, chemistry is both a concept and content-heavy subject so you really have to pay attention during lectures. (oops sit at back of lecture gang that kena called out by the lecturer before) Read your notes thoroughly because there are often little pointers hidden within them (e.g. there was this reaction I didn’t know that produced ammonia as one of the products) When you encounter something new in a paper, put a tab on it, and write it down in your notes. I had a notebook for chemistry practicals and a foolscap thing for a concept map + little learning points I picked up for the various other topics.</p>

<div class="imgcontainer">
  <img src="Dear Juniors8381.png" 
  alt="chemnote1" width="400" height="600">
</div>
<div class="imgcontainer">
  <img src="Dear Juniors8382.png" 
  alt="chemnote2" width="400" height="600">
</div>

<p>For the reactions or standard practical procedures like weighing a substance to memorise, you can use the Anki Deck. Or if you feel phone usage is distracting, I also wrote down the reactions especially for periodic table on little square sheets of paper like flashcards, with one side of the paper being the element and the other being the reactions. You need to keep practising writing without reference, especially for the Planning section of the practical and for the standard answers e.g. difference in melting points of ionic compounds.</p>
<p>Make sure you go through all your papers and all the key words. Definitions are not important in chemistry, only once in a while would you get a question like “define half-life” but if you’re sure you’ve mastered the more important parts then you can cram some definitions. Just keep doing papers: there’s no way around it. Do the school’s topical revision packages, and ask if in doubt.</p>
<hr>

<hr>
<h1>H2 Math!</h1>
<div class="imgcontainer">
  <img src="Dear Juniors9325.png" 
  alt="mathcube" width="400" height="600">
</div>
<p>Just do papers: there’s no way around it. To be honest, the past year
  Ten-Year-Series are not very helpful in terms of exposure to the more
  challenging questions, so do the other schools’ prelim papers. Math is
  the lightest subject in terms of content amongst all of these (except for
  the statistics topics, one of which is going to be removed for the 2020 A
  Levels I heard), so it is really about applying what you learnt to all sorts
  of diverse scenarios. Hwa Chong papers are great. #自强不息 </p>

  <p>Keep a spare GC by borrowing from your
  seniors/or spare scientific calculators. I remember
  doing the whole of S6 tutorial manually… anyway that’s not in your
  syllabus, but for the stats questions it’s really important to check your
  answers. </p>

  <p>And even the scientific calculator can be used to check answers, such
  as for quadratic roots and for simultaneous equations. Also, stuff that
  appear correct on paper may give you the wrong answer on GC e.g.
  when you log (something)³ , the GC will cube the whole thing instead!
  Please do use your brackets properly and cross-check with different
  calculators if possible.</p>

<hr>
<h1>H2 Physics!</h1>

<p>Spam questions, spam asking them if you’re not sure how the concept is applied in the case of the question.</p>
<p>I think a question that I and many people face would be: what equation
  do I use? Armed with an artillery of concepts and equations, sometimes
  it is not clear at first glance which one to use especially when faced with
  a complex diagram and a long description. And speed is key in an exam.</p>

<p>The only way past that is familiarity. When you’ve spammed so many
  questions that you’re familiar with most types, then you’ll have that
  sense of security. Admittedly, I was far from finishing all the topical
  revision exercises (see pic: many other unfinished things please come to
  collect) given by the school, but once closer to prelims and A Levels, it’s
  just about doing other schools’ papers.</p>
  <div class="imgcontainer">
    <img src="Dear Juniors9940.png" 
    alt="" width="400" height="600">
  </div>

 <h5>Fun fact: about 5 physics MCQs in
  the 2019 A levels were recycled
  from the Ten Year Series! So
  please finish all your physics MCQs at least. Actually just finish your
  physics TYS for an understanding of the phrasing and key words to be
  used.</h5> 

<h4>Physics definitions:</h3>
<p>I used AnkiDroid (see the start for the list of apps)
  in the last month leading up to A levels extensively, and it helped me
  when my friends and I tested each other. I would also adopt the usage of
  a younger sibling to recite out a physics term and check if I could recall
  the definition corresponding to the definition sheet.</p>
<hr>

<h1>H2 German</h1>

<p>Mmm yes GP, but in German. Fun fact: German has one of the highest, if not the
  highest A rate for A Levels amongst the H2 Third Language subjects.</p>

<p>For listening, listening to <a href="deutschland.fm">Deutschland.fm</a> worked out the best for me, specifically
  the news channels like B5 Aktuell, especially when I’m on the go and have my
  phone with me. When I was in Year 4 and some time in Year 5, I also listened to the
  2 minute audio clips on Deutsche Welle -> Top Thema, and wrote down what I
  could discern. Although I had a strong foundation, I still made grammatical errors like
  Adjektivendungen and subject-verb agreement so review your mistakes, and also
  learn from your more adept classmates.</p>

<p>For reading/writing, what I learnt from my H2 French friend was to find news articles
  online and print them out to read/highlight! Since the topics are a few specific
  domains of current affairs, you can print out some that you are interested in and
  learn from the vocabulary, and maybe inspire your coursework topic! There is
  honestly not that much reading material provided, depending on your teacher, and
  many of the lessons were discussion-based, so supplement your learning. You can
  find argumentative essays online and common starting phrases when introducing a
  new point, or a contradicting view, or starting and concluding. There not much room
  for flair given the limited word count of 400 words – please give yourself some time
  to count at the end as they did not allow calculators for A Levels to tally your essay
  word count.</p>
<div class="imgcontainer">
  <img src="Dear Juniors12644.png" 
  alt="" width="400" height="600">
</div>

<p>Coursework: find something that you’re interested in, but also where there is some
  form of resource available online. My topics were morbid and niche but I enjoyed
  excavating the morsels of information available online, even if they’re a little niche!
  Design for me was minimal and it’s helpful to send your drafts, if you can, to your
  German buddies! I sent mine to a German university student I met during the
  PASCH programme and am eternally grateful for his inputs. </p>
<p>For queries specifically on H1 German/H2 French/H2 Japanese/H2 Spanish I can
  redirect you to my other MOELC schoolmates. :D</p>

<hr>

<h1>H3 METH!</h1>

<p>HAHAH for any J1s considering H3 Math, please start doing your H3 stuff early,
  see the past year papers to get an idea of the monstrosity you’re about to face (HMU
  if you need them) and read up on Number Theory (many textbooks are now
  available online). If you haven’t trained for Math Olympiads like me, chances are the
  learning curve is going to be extremely steep – I was lost for all the lectures and
  assignments and didn’t know what was going on 99% of the time. I would read the
  answers many times and not understand them, let alone conjure such magical
  answers out of thin air. I would re-listen to the lecture recordings and slow them
  down but remain befuddled.</p>

<p><h3>Never go into a war without reckoning out the battle you’re facing, you’ll get
  rude awakenings. </h3>The biggest mistake I made was procrastinate the content and
  not having the courage to face my weaknesses, thinking that I would drop it or
  something (my tests went something like, just pass, fail, fail, Prelims: just pass).
  Eventually, I persevered but the last few months were pretty painful, I only went for 2
  consults with the teachers, but I asked the Math Olympiad gods extensively for help
  and gave myself some space to think over the questions.</p>

<p><h3>GIVE YOURSELF SPACE – both literally and figuratively. </h3>The mental space to
  think, and the physical space to write down your chain of thoughts (I used a huge
  notebook). You’ll get working marks for your proofs even if you do not arrive at the
  final answer. If you’re at a loss as to where to start, don’t read through the whole
  answer yet! See the first few steps and think of how to work from there.</p>

<p>H3 Math is a lot more guided compared to Math Olympiad: you can skip an
  earlier part of the question and still be able to do subsequent parts. In addition, for
  combinatorics and Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM, they are usually pretty standard –
  please memorise all your combinatorics proofs. It’s the random number theory
  stuff that need a wider exposure of questions, and actually one of the 2019 A Level
  Questions appeared in the 2017 Meridian JC Paper, so do the past year prelims!
  And in fact, some A Level questions repeat too. :D</p>
