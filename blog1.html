<h1>Dear Juniors,</h1>
<p1>I’m Simon, RI ’19 and currently serving my NS in the police force. I took H2 Physics, Chemistry, Math and German, H1 General Paper, and H3 Math for A Levels. Having done well eventually, I decided to collate the tools and tips for each subject that helped me tide through A Levels especially in the months leading up to it. If there’s anything below that you’re not sure about, or resources that you want like PDF notes or AnkiDecks, feel free to drop me an email at simon_smile2011@yahoo.com.sg.
  As an INFP who is primarily affected and driven by emotions, I understand the feelings that many of you might be afflicted with now during the circuit breaker: confusion, crippling anxiety, and perhaps guilt accompanying the inability to focus on the unconventional lesson style of online delivery. It is okay to feel those, and I have felt those before in the revision period pre-A Levels. （〠_〠） It is fine to not do well because given consistent effort and being AWARE of yourself and the syllabus content, you’ll be on an upward trend: have faith! And recite this mantra:</p1>

<h2>How I dealt with it in 2019:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Video called my dad to share my stresses and worries</li>
  <li>Take strolls downstairs with my mum</li>
  <li>Run to the park connectors to release them endorphins</li>
  <li>Find people I like to study with who’ll peer pressure motivate me to focus (or play pool to unwind a little)</li>
  <li>Phone/vid call people - especially pertinent in this period</li>
  <li>Write encouraging cards for people and hopefully receive them too #BOOMER</li>
  <li>Also, complete My RI Journey [it's a template to fill in reflections and activities which helped with my understanding of self and to consolidate the things I did outside of academics] to give myself a breather</li>
</ol>
