         Every internship rejection is not a reflection of your worth; but it still offers a reflection of the pastâ€”my experiences previously getting rejected, preparation, and circumstances at the time. It is also bi-directional - whatever I fed to the company in my resume, interview and cover letter was already an acceptance or rejection in itself.
