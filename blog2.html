<h1>COVID-19 FUNDS FOR FOREIGN WORKERS</h1>
<p1>In view of the current situation, I would like to beseech you to donate to the following NGOs that provide assistance to foreign workers, and more if possible: HOME, MWC and TWC2, to support our foreign workers as cases rise everyday in Singapore. I would also like to offer video call tuition and university consultation in exchange for your donation of $30 or more to these organisations. </p1>
<p>The links to donate are as follows:</p>
